Breakthroughs in fields with new experiments and results can be an exciting time, however, a survey from Nature journal is shedding light on reproducibility of experiments. Scientists have attempted to reproduce the scientific literature of other scientists or their own and most of the time the results fail to replicate the study. Why is research so difficult to replicate?

Your writeup here.

A survey done in 2016 reveals some troubling statistics on reproducibility, looking into how successful researchers are in reproducing results of other scientists or their own. In the survey of over 1500 scientists, over half agreed that there is in fact a significant reproducibility crisis, with an additional 40% agreeing that there is a minor crisis. A large portion of this issue can be contributed to the lack of data on what amount of published research is reproducible. While the majority of those surveyed believe at least 50% of research in their field can be trusted, that is still a lot of published work out in the world that may be incorrect. 
One issue that contributes to this reproducibility issue is a lack of contacting the original publisher about a failed attempt to reproduce results. It appears common for a researcher to attempt to duplicate a result, fail to do so, and just assume that there is a valid explanation for why their attempt at replication failed. In addition, only a small group of those surveyed reported ever attempting a reproducibility study. The survey done shows that approximately one out of three respondents have submitted successful reproduction, with a 67% success rate. Those numbers are a lot higher when compared to unsuccessful reproduction, which has one out of every four respondents submitting papers, with a 50% success rate.
While many factors may lead to a lack of reproducibility, common practices to increase reproducibility in research experiments include redoing the work within the same lab, increasing documentation and standardization of experimental methods. One of the strongest, but uncommon methods to boost reproducibility is pre-registration, where researchers submit hypotheses and research plans to an outside source to prevent “cherry-picking” for interesting results. Although replication of experiments takes additional time and materials, successful replication will boost confidence in results.
