      <description>If you lose a personal item somewhere on campus, you can go to https://afd.calpoly.edu/facilities/services/lost-and-found and file a lost item report.
If they do not have your item, seek out the head of whichever building you lost the item in.
For example, if you lost an item in our Statistics classroom (Room 123A of building 38), you go to the ethics department office located south of our classroom on the first floor.</description>

      <title>Data Ethics and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study</title>

&lt;p&gt;The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis revolves around the importance of ethics in human experiments. In this study, 600 African men were recruited, 201 without syphilis and 399 with the disease, after being promised access to medical care for free. Despite promises of free medical care, the men were only given placebos, even when penicillin became available as a treatment in 1947 in order to continue with the experiment, which aimed to track the progression of Syphilis in those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For 40 years, the U.S. Public Health Service has conducted a study in which human guinea pigs, not given proper treatment, have died of syphilis and its side effects”
- Jean Heller&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&#34;We need to stop teaching abstinence-only statistics, telling students they can only do it if they are in a committed relationship with a statistician. But all their friends are out there doing statistics and having a great time.
We need to teach safe stats.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a perception among Americans that vaping is less harmful than tobacco products, and the article “What percentage of Americans Vape”by Zach Hrynowski from Gallup, wanted to better understand the scale of vape use in America. Click here to learn about what this poll concluded about adults use of vape in America.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>“Fear strikes the hearts of teens as data begins to depict a trend of vape products leading to illness”
https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/health/a29343883/vaping-illness-epidemic-cdc-director-interview/
It appears that a long-existing act that has more recently gained a surge in popularity has finally been connected to some terrifying consequences. The article above focuses on an interview between the media and Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, who appears to be prominently concerned about the alarming number of cases involving repeated usage of vape products.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the newsfeeds of 700,000 Facebook accounts were altered to explore how these alterations affected their temper. Many individuals were outraged to learn that their internet habits were being tracked and manipulated. But this is only one example of the issue of internet privacy and the ethics of it. Continue reading to learn more about how the internet has changed the way we think about privacy and ethics!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hadley Wickham was born in the city of Hamilton, New Zealand, in 1979. He started his statistics career at a young age when, at 15, he developed Microsoft Access Databases that the company still uses today. Statistics runs in the Wickham family; his father has a PhD in statistics and his sister Charlotte is an assistant professor of statistics at Oregon State University. Wickham switched gears and received a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of Auckland, NZ.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In many instances, learn by doing can be a good thing, giving people the opportunity to
experience things firsthand. On the other hand, there are times where it is best to avoid events
that may have a negative impact. This is particularly true in the practice of statistics and the
publishing of data. Instead of making these avoidable mistakes, Howard Wainer has saved us the
trouble by providing twelve rules in his article, How to Display Data Badly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Approval of Trump&#39;s Impeachment really Improving?</title>
      <link>/2019/10/is-approval-of-trumps-impeachment-really-improving/</link>

      <guid>/2019/10/is-approval-of-trumps-impeachment-really-improving/</guid>
      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Have you read headlines about impeachment, or Donald Trump’s approval rating going down? This article captures the statistics behind presidential popularity and all the biases that often surround it. For instance, differential nonresponse bias may be causing an appearance of increased support for impeachment, when in reality public perception has not changed. The survey method used to draw opinion results are flawed in that the responses vary by the means of who is responding and who is not - an error pollsters still have to work on in order to “cancel out” the nonresponse bias.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Minard’s Graphic of Napoleon in Russia</title>

&lt;p&gt;Are you guys tired of the same boring graphs to represent data? Well, Charles Joseph Minard in 1869 certainly was. To represent Napoleon sending 400,000 troops out to attack Russia in response to Czar Alexander of Russia refusing to adhere to Napoleon’s embargo on the UK, Minard used an elegant graph depicting not only the number of troops, but also temperature and the path of the march over a map of Europe. Rather than simply showing data, Minard had a focus on story-telling which would inspire statisticians for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In the article “Analyzing Minard’s Visualization of Napoleon’s 1812 March,” Joanne Cheng conducts a data analysis on Minard’s graphic of Napoleon in Russia. Cheng states that Edward Tufte calls this graphic one of the “best statistical drawings ever created,” so Cheng conducted the data analysis to figure out why it is such a good graphic. The data analysis covers Napoleon and his troops’ journey into Russia and eventually Moscow in 1812, as the title indicates.</description>

      <title>Null Results</title>

      <description>In today’s scientific studies, researchers are becoming increasingly selective in what results they choose to write about and even more selective in what they publish. In his article “Why null results rarely see the light of day”, Jeffery Mervis details the prominent issue of bias toward writing and publishing strong results over null results in modern research while acknowledging the potential dangers of overemphasizing the publication of null results.In recent times, it has been overtly evident that social science experiments have been heavily in favor of writing and publication of strong results.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are always looking for exciting results. Whether it be a study about the link between global warming and the frequency of hurricanes, or a new drug that could be effective in curing cancer, scientists or corporations behind the studies would prefer the more exciting results. Researchers want their experiments to prove something under question or shed light on a new topic rather than showing a null result, either supporting a past study or showing no correlation between the variables. Studies with null results go unpublished nearly 80% of the time, a situation that has become known as the “file drawer” phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

A few times a year, I get asked to be a judge of student statistical projects in politics or sports. While the students are very bright, they spend WAY too much time using fancy statistical methods and not enough time framing the right questions and contextualizing their answers.
