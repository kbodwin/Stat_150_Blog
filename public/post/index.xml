      <description>The data study included two articles this week, the first being a 1982 article by Ralph Bradley. Bradley speaks about the important future in the field and the need for new, young statisticians to support the ever-growing field. He spoke about the need to keep statistics relevant to current real-life applications and how good training will be important as statistics will reach more fields than ever as technology progresses. The second article was from 2002 where the National Science Foundation where they examined the field of statistics as a whole where they found the field was expanding well and growing into many new fields.</description>

      <description>Pregnant mother abuses opioids, punish her: seems reasonable, right?, especially considering the opioid epidemic that is ongoing in the United States and showing no signs of slowing down. The way this punishment is being carried out is by either criminalizing the mother or removing the baby from the mother. However, new data that is contained in this article clearly shows that this only makes things worse, as it pushes mothers dealing with opioid addiction into the shadows and away from the help they desperately need, and significantly increases the number of newborns who contend with drug withdrawal and thus is not beneficial for either the baby or the mother.</description>

      <description>Do vaccines cause autism? In a study published in 2009, Jeffrey Gerber and Paul Offit try to determine if the components in a vaccine result in increased rates of autism. They conclude the research by assessing a variety of hypothesizes individually. Stick around to see if the vaccinations impact social skills, neurological behavior, and communication.

      <description>Teaser text or links here.
Breakthroughs in fields with new experiments and results can be an exciting time, however, a survey from Nature journal is shedding light on reproducibility of experiments. Scientists have attempted to reproduce the scientific literature of other scientists or their own and most of the time the results fail to replicate the study. Why is research so difficult to replicate?

      <description>Have you ever seen multiple, varying statistics for the same experiment? Have you tried and failed to recreate your own? That’s actually a lot more common than you think, even for professional. A Nature journal survey of 1,576 researchers shows just how many data professional have tried and failed to reproduce experiments by others and by their own selves. Being able to reproduce an experiment further confirms or denies first results.</description>

      <description>“I look upon statistics as the handmaid of medicine, but on that very account I hold that it befits medicine to treat her handmaid with proper respect, and not to prostitute her services for controversial or personal purposes.”- Karl Pearson
(https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Pearson)(https://todayinsci.com/P/Pearson_Karl/PearsonKarl-Quotations.htm)
Karl Pearson served as a leading founder in the modern field of statistics. Born in 1857 in London, England, Pearson spent many of his early years following the religious beliefs of his Quaker ancestry and it wasn’t until his mid-twenties that he decided to lean away from that, opting instead to explore his academic interests while slowly becoming more of an agnostic.</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) appears in our daily lives through the ads that appear on websites to filtering out spam in emails. However AI can also be used for purposes with larger impacts such as assessing a criminal’s likelihood to recommit a crime or screening applications for positions or limited numbered places, like loans. So, what prevents machines and algorithms from giving preference to factors like certain groups of people? Bias from human creators and coders can make its way into machine algorithms to create machine biases. Keep reading to explore how machine learning bias can affect internet users and solutions to this increasingly important issue.&lt;/p&gt;

Racism and discrimination are still prevalent topics in today’s society. The effects of both reach almost all aspects of life. One of those aspects is the job market. Historically, companies were more likely to hire someone with a white sounding name over someone ca with a black sounding name.</description>

      <description>We are living in a digital age. Machines have become fully integrated into our daily lives; phones, television, electric toothbrushes, you name it. The use of artificial intelligence in data studies is rapidly increasing. But what are the ethical consequences when this machinery is taken too far? The study “Ethics and Bias in Machine Learning: A Technical Study of What Makes Us ‘Good’” by Ashley Nicole Shadowen examines this ethical dilemma.</description>

      <description>At 805 Kitchen, to spice up your waffle, DO NOT grab toppings from the yogurt bar (chocolate chips, coconut flakes, etc) and add it into your waffle batter before cooking your waffle. There have been reports of severe allergic reactions where the ambulance has been required to come according to staff working there. If you want to up your waffle game, then please do it afterwards and simply add it to the finished waffle product.</description>

      <title>Is Statistics More Important Than Calculus?</title>

      <description>Learning statistics should be prioritized before studying calculus.
Ever wonder when calculus is actually going to be useful? Most schools design math classes in a way that builds up to the idea of calculus; calculus may not be useful for everyone. Arthur Benjamin, in his TED Talk “Teach Statistics Before Calculus,” advocates for placing priority on the education of statistics over calculus. Of course for students in the field of math, science, engineering, or economics, calculus is essential class to take, but others may find the study irrelevant in their daily lives.</description>

      <description>“Be approximately right rather than exactly wrong.”
John Tukey was an American statistician of the mid 1900’s who played a significant role in introducing concepts and terminology used in modern statistics. Born in 1915, Tukey was homeschooled by both his parents who were teachers. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in chemistry at Brown University and a Master’s Degree a year later. He then attended Princeton University to study mathematics and obtained his Ph.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In this TED talk, Professor Arthur Benjamin of Harvey Mudd University describes his thoughts on mathematics curriculum and how it’s attachment to calculus is somewhat archaic, and a newer more useful approach would be to focus on statistics and a more modern and concrete approach to mathematics using statistics and data.

      <description>As it turns out, clinical trials aren’t so clinical after all. Not what you would expect, right? The primary reason for this is the manipulation of test results by researchers that is encouraged by many academic journals, as they typically have a strong preference of publishing positive test results - those that show a treatment works better than previous ones - rather than those that are negative - those that show a treatment doesn’t work or isn’t as effective as previous ones.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The National Research Act for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was signed into law in 1974, and without this act today, many more individuals may have passed away due to violation of basic human ethics in research experiments. The focus of this act revolved rules regarding human experiments, such as having respect for persons, beneficence, and justice Research experiments have previously targeted powerless individuals, so this act marked huge progress in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>While the advent of scientific experiments has provided countless contributions to mankind, it is important that ethics get highly considered before the conduction of such experiments. After numerous atrocities were committed during WWII including the use of human subjects, the Nuremberg code was drafted to impose guidelines upon physicians and scientists as to how to treat their subjects. The three main sections of this code include: the distinction between research and practice, a discussion of the three basic principles of ethics, and the applications of these principles.</description>

      <description>Have you ever read something that suspiciously links a certain medicine or food or something random to a serious medical condition? As patients, we’re taught that people in the medical field are trustworthy; however, some release very suspicious and questionable research conclusions that are complete frauds. John Carlisle is a statistical researcher and consultant anaesthetist working to help find and debunk fraud in medical research. In the following article, there is a conversation about major incidents of research frauds and how researchers like Carlisle are using statistics to seek out the red flags of sketchy research practices.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Stanford Prison Experiment was a study conducted by Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford psychologist who ran the study at Stanford University in 1971. It is a controversial experiment that tried to draw conclusions about human power dynamics by assigning paid volunteers either the role of “inmate” or “guard” in a fake prison at the University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis revolves around the importance of ethics in human experiments. In this study, 600 African men were recruited, 201 without syphilis and 399 with the disease, after being promised access to medical care for free. Despite promises of free medical care, the men were only given placebos, even when penicillin became available as a treatment in 1947 in order to continue with the experiment, which aimed to track the progression of Syphilis in those affected.&lt;/p&gt;

Brain Wansink is being removed from his once prominent position as director for Cornell’ Food and Brand Lab, where he was considered an eating behavior expert. Wansink’s offenses that include “missreporting of research data, problematic statistical techniques, failure to properly document and preserve research results, and inappropriate authorship,” said Michael I. Kotlikoff, another senior researcher at Cornell.&lt;/p&gt;

https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/health/a29343883/vaping-illness-epidemic-cdc-director-interview/
It appears that a long-existing act that has more recently gained a surge in popularity has finally been connected to some terrifying consequences. The article above focuses on an interview between the media and Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, who appears to be prominently concerned about the alarming number of cases involving repeated usage of vape products.</description>

Neither of these facts have hindered Meng. He’s had over 300 seminars, written over 150 publications, and has earned 2 major awards.

      <description>Hadley Wickham was born in the city of Hamilton, New Zealand, in 1979. He started his statistics career at a young age when, at 15, he developed Microsoft Access Databases that the company still uses today. Statistics runs in the Wickham family; his father has a PhD in statistics and his sister Charlotte is an assistant professor of statistics at Oregon State University. Wickham switched gears and received a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of Auckland, NZ.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In many instances, learn by doing can be a good thing, giving people the opportunity to
experience things firsthand. On the other hand, there are times where it is best to avoid events
that may have a negative impact. This is particularly true in the practice of statistics and the
publishing of data. Instead of making these avoidable mistakes, Howard Wainer has saved us the
trouble by providing twelve rules in his article, How to Display Data Badly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Have you read headlines about impeachment, or Donald Trump’s approval rating going down? This article captures the statistics behind presidential popularity and all the biases that often surround it. For instance, differential nonresponse bias may be causing an appearance of increased support for impeachment, when in reality public perception has not changed. The survey method used to draw opinion results are flawed in that the responses vary by the means of who is responding and who is not - an error pollsters still have to work on in order to “cancel out” the nonresponse bias.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Are you guys tired of the same boring graphs to represent data? Well, Charles Joseph Minard in 1869 certainly was. To represent Napoleon sending 400,000 troops out to attack Russia in response to Czar Alexander of Russia refusing to adhere to Napoleon’s embargo on the UK, Minard used an elegant graph depicting not only the number of troops, but also temperature and the path of the march over a map of Europe. Rather than simply showing data, Minard had a focus on story-telling which would inspire statisticians for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In the article “Analyzing Minard’s Visualization of Napoleon’s 1812 March,” Joanne Cheng conducts a data analysis on Minard’s graphic of Napoleon in Russia. Cheng states that Edward Tufte calls this graphic one of the “best statistical drawings ever created,” so Cheng conducted the data analysis to figure out why it is such a good graphic. The data analysis covers Napoleon and his troops’ journey into Russia and eventually Moscow in 1812, as the title indicates.</description>

      <description>This data study proves that some academics don’t know how p-values are significant. Get it? Significant? A group of students from the University of Valencia in Spain conducted a study to show the importance of the p-value in academic psychologist research. In their study, they wanted to see how often p-values are misinterpreted; by looking at the outcomes of a test given, they noticed that there are many ways to misinterpret p-values.</description>

      <description>In today’s scientific studies, researchers are becoming increasingly selective in what results they choose to write about and even more selective in what they publish. In his article “Why null results rarely see the light of day”, Jeffery Mervis details the prominent issue of bias toward writing and publishing strong results over null results in modern research while acknowledging the potential dangers of overemphasizing the publication of null results.In recent times, it has been overtly evident that social science experiments have been heavily in favor of writing and publication of strong results.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are always looking for exciting results. Whether it be a study about the link between global warming and the frequency of hurricanes, or a new drug that could be effective in curing cancer, scientists or corporations behind the studies would prefer the more exciting results. Researchers want their experiments to prove something under question or shed light on a new topic rather than showing a null result, either supporting a past study or showing no correlation between the variables. Studies with null results go unpublished nearly 80% of the time, a situation that has become known as the “file drawer” phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>An understanding of statistics is necessary to be able to correctly interpret the data we see and understand it’s validity. However, there are many common misunderstandings surrounding statistics and probability. Without an understanding of the validity of findings, people, even those who have been taught introductory statistics, can be led to false conclusions with real world consequences.
Responsible Statistic Education and Common Misinterpretations

      <description>San Francisco, Oakland-Berkeley and to a lesser extent San Mateo County have been outperforming the rest of the Bay Area since spring, according to Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst with the Compass real estate brokerage. “My best guess is that the differentiating factor (in these markets) is all the IPOs that have occurred over the last six months,” he said — even though it wasn’t “the hysterical jump” in prices that some were anticipating.</description>
