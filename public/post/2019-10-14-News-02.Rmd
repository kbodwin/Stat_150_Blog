> "Fear strikes the hearts of teens as data begins to depict a trend of vape products leading to illness"

https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/health/a29343883/vaping-illness-epidemic-cdc-director-interview/

  It appears that a long-existing act that has more recently gained a surge in popularity has finally been connected to some terrifying consequences. The article above focuses on an interview between the media and Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, who appears to be prominently concerned about the alarming number of cases involving repeated usage of vape products. Throughout the article, several pieces of data are cited including an observational study in which it was found that over 1,000 cases of vape-related illnesses had been reported with 18 of said cases passing away. Of those 1,000+ cases, 80% of victims were under the age of 35. Of the 500 that the CDC was able to investigate more thoroughly, nearly 400 were associated with THC-containing products while 16% of the 500 cases were strictly nicotine based. All of this data was collected personally by the CDC and the hospitals they contacted by responsible and legitimate means in a way that ensures said information is truthful.
  The data serves as a necessary delivery system of this information. To convey the point the CDC has been trying to communicate, there had to be some solid evidence of the consequences of these products as this is one of the first times any sort of study has been done on this data.
  The article could have benefitted however from interviewing more than just one person in the CDC. While Redfield is indeed the director and likely one of the best people they could have interviewed about the topic at hand, there were likely many other experts on the study who would have worked closely and personally with many of the cases sited and been able to provide some great insights into the subject.
  Overall, this article was a good representation of the data they were trying to convey as it stuck largely to the facts of what has been reported and serves as a legitimate example of a present-day news article in which statistics are extremely relevant.
