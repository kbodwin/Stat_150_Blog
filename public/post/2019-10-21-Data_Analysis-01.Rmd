The Stanford Prison Experiment was a study conducted by Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford psychologist who ran the study at Stanford University in 1971. It is a controversial experiment that tried to draw conclusions about human power dynamics by assigning paid volunteers either the role of “inmate” or “guard” in a fake prison at the University.

The Stanford Prison Experiment was a study conducted by Philip Zimbardo, a Professor of Psychology who ran the study at Stanford University in 1971. It took paid volunteers who were then assigned either the role of “inmates” or “guards” in a fake prison at the University. They wanted to better understand the power dynamic between prisoners and guards, and hypothesized that the inherent personality traits of prisoners and guards would be the chief cause of abusive behavior in prison. After the “guards” began mistreating the “prisoners”, the authors concluded that evil is brought on by circumstance. Meaning they thought that innocent people put into a place of power over others would naturally abuse it, and people put in situations where they are powerless will submit. However, this study has often been scrutinized for being deceitful and many think of it as “more of a dramatic demonstration, a sort-of academic reality show, than a serious bit of science”(Resnick). Many believe this study should be removed from psychology textbooks since many believe the results were coaxed out of the participants, and is inconsistent. 
Along with the Stanford Prison Experiment, many other well-known, accepted psychological studies and theories are under scrutiny and are being refuted. Scientists are realizing that many of these studies are not in-depth enough or are very flawed. Every time scientists conduct an experiment, there's a chance they'll find a false positive, but psychologists are now realizing that institutions are structured so that it is more likely that false positives will make it through to publication than inconclusive results.Over the past decade, studies were conducted that began to suggest that major discoveries in psychology may be the result of experimenter bias. In one paper, psychologists showed that standard statistical practices could be used to make just about any effect appear significant. This is relevant in the Stanford Prison Experiment because it was quoted in so many textbooks, and now is believed to not even be accurate or credible. 
In the Stanford Prison Experiment, participants in the study have admitted to acting in a way that they believed would help the research the most. The fact that they were acting shows that the findings from this experiment should not be accepted as a principle of human behavior and should be thrown out of textbooks. The takeaway message from this is that these studies need to be reevaluated and probed for errors before they are accepted as fact. A lot of false information and knowledge is spread through textbooks containing findings from these flawed experiments. The behavior of humans is too advanced to be explained through old, simple studies without reexamination and confirmation.

This plot visualizes the difference between effect sizes claimed by original studies and replications. As we can see, the original studies, much like the Stanford Prison Experiment, are often very far from what more rigorous research would find. This should reinforce the idea that significant conclusions should not be made from single, insignificant studies.
