In today’s scientific studies, researchers are becoming increasingly selective in what results they choose to write about and even more selective in what they publish. In his article “Why null results rarely see the light of day”, Jeffery Mervis details the prominent issue of bias toward writing and publishing strong results over null results in modern research while acknowledging the potential dangers of overemphasizing the publication of null results. 
	In recent times, it has been overtly evident that social science experiments have been heavily in favor of writing and publication of strong results. Mervis referenced a study published in Science, which followed survey-based experiments funded by the National Science Foundation. The study, done by Stanford University, found that nearly “[66%] of the… experiments [that] produced null results… were filed away”.  This is in stark contrast to the experiments that produced strong results, of which 96% were written up. This creates “wasteful duplication” and “skew[s] the literature”, according to the researchers at Stanford.

	However, there is a considerable concern to push for null results to be pushed to the forefront of publications as well. Gary King, a political scientist from Harvard University, argues that “unpublished findings” shouldn’t have “the same prominence as those containing strong results” because that could potentially introduce new biases more harmful than those existing in modern publication. In fact, null results are often in the dark for a reason. A common misconception, according to Mervis, is that the leading cause for unwritten null results is that they are boring or uninteresting. And while the interest of these results is certainly a factor in their publication, it is not the only factor contributing to the bias. King says there are “many, many ways to produce null results by messing up. So they are much harder to interpret”. Effectively, this means that a null result is inherently less trustworthy than a strong result, as there are more possible explanatory variables for every null result.
	So, the solution? Malholtra, a Stanford political economist, suggests that for a more equal evaluation of all results, the change needs to start in the culture surrounding “the author’s belief about what will happen if the research is written up”. The bias against null results should be corrected sooner as opposed to later, as there are residual effects of biased studies in the past that still resonate today. Edward Miguel of The University of California points out that statistically significant results in the future could seem even more significant if null results in the past had not been published in opposition to the new studies because of the bias. The publication of null results serves the fundamental role of invalidating unreplicated studies that many publication sources latch onto. The sooner the issue of significant bias if quelmed, the less effect it will have.
	In conclusion, there needs to be change in the biases of research studies, as it has effects that will extend into the distant future. It has considerable effects on society and requires a change at the cultural level that will affect researchers and dissuade them from favoring significant results. With a proper treatment, this plague affecting modern research can be eradicated swiftly.
