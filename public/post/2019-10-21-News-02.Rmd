Would you feed your child paint on a daily basis? According to the article, “95% of baby foods tested contain toxic metals that could lower babies' IQ, study finds,” the nonprofit organization Healthy Babies Bright Future (HBBF) found that “95% of the baby foods tested contained traces of toxic chemicals, including lead and arsenic.”

Your writeup here.

An article by author Caitlin O’Kane describes how the recent study by Healthy Babies Bright Future (HBBF) raises concerns about traces of toxic chemicals found in a large majority of baby food. The study concluded that of the 168 baby foods tested, 95% of the containers had heavy toxic metals, including lead and arsenic, while only 9 containers did not. The baby food containers tested were selected from a range of 61 different brands and included 13 different types of food. The study specifically looked for arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury. Arsenic is a carcinogen, a cancer-causing substance, and may be linked to heart disease. Lead can cause damage to a child’s brain development. Arsenic traces were found in 73% of the baby food containers tested, while lead was found in 94%. Researchers heeded that even trace amounts of toxic heavy metals can build up to alter a child’s developing brain. While there is technically “no enforceable federal safety limit” for heavy metals in baby foods, the HBBF is fighting for stricter FDA limits, in addition to calling for the baby food companies to take steps in limiting the metals used in their products.

The article did a good job presenting the data in the study done by HBBF, providing useful statistics that reflected how the majority of baby food companies have toxic metals in their product. The article provided the four main metals that were tested for (arsenic, lead, cadmium, and mercury) and provided information on how one in four of the baby foods tested had all four toxic metals, while two in five of the baby foods have three of the four toxic metals. However, one issue with the article is the irrelevance of random statistics unrelated to the study near the end of the article. The CBS article goes off topic and starts giving information on how certain food items such as rice and fruit juices can contain similar toxic metals, and therefore parents should give their children rice free snacks and water as a substitute. While this information is useful knowledge, it does not relate to the main focus of the article, which is the presence of heavy metals in baby foods and HBBF’s efforts to increase the restrictions surrounding these companies.
