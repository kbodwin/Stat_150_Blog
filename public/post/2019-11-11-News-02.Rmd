Sorry millennials, The War on Drugs isn’t just a mainstream rock bank to get your feels on. Unfortunately, the nation has its own ‘War on Drugs’ costing the lives and futures of millions of Americans.

After an overall decrease in drug arrests between 2006 and 2015, many believed that the ‘War on Drugs’ was over. However, over the past few years, statistics have shown an increase in drug arrests once again. Drug arrests have been increasing each year since 2015 and drugs have become the leading reason behind arrests. There have been more arrests related to drugs than there has been for violence, as the number of violence crimes has been decreasing.  

The most common drug that people are arrested for is marijuana, and most arrests are for drug possession. In addition, most drug arrests involve possession of just a very little amount. Nevertheless, even being caught possessing a small amount of marijuana can be harmful for one’s future. Drug arrests are recorded and must be explained for on forms such as job applications and housing applications. As a result, it could hurt one’s chances of getting hired, as employers might feel skeptical because of the poor background. The racial disparities among the arrests are also very noticeable. There is a larger percentage of blacks and Hispanics being arrested for drug related reasons, even if they are minorities and make up a smaller percentage of the population of the city/state.  

Data that was presented in this article was taken from the crime statistics that were released by the FBI. The FBI annual report compiles data from 18,586 law enforcement agencies (federal, state, and local levels) that voluntarily submit/contribute data about crimes and arrests. There are 18,586 law enforcement agencies participating in this program, which is called Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR). The high percentage of reporting agencies does result in consistent and conclusive results. However, such representations do not come without imperfections. Not all the agencies report each year, as submission of data is voluntary. This can result in incomplete data, and therefore, incomplete results.
