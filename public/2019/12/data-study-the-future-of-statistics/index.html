<p>The data study included two articles this week, the first being a 1982 article by Ralph Bradley. Bradley speaks about the important future in the field and the need for new, young statisticians to support the ever-growing field. He spoke about the need to keep statistics relevant to current real-life applications and how good training will be important as statistics will reach more fields than ever as technology progresses. The second article was from 2002 where the National Science Foundation where they examined the field of statistics as a whole where they found the field was expanding well and growing into many new fields. One challenge the field faces is the growing amount of data existing in every field and how to deal with mass quantities and data compression.</p>
<p>Writeup:</p>
<p>In 1982 Ralph Bradley, then president of the American Statistical Association, gave a speech to the annual meeting of that body in which he discussed the future of statistics as he saw it, particularly as it related to the ASA. Bradley began by discussing statistics broadly as a branch of human study, and it’s relation to other areas of study. He then turned to the death of new statisticians during that time and the need for the recruitment of young people into statistics. Directly related to this, Bradley discussed training in statistics, and the need for a balance between or a combination of highly theoretical statistical training, and more application-based teaching. He then addressed his concerns with statistical research, especially the need to keep statistics research relevant to real-life statistical applications. Finally, Bradley discussed the need to keep statistics from splintering into competing factions, while preserving the unique diversity that statistics possesses, with its wide range of applications. Given our limited space, I want to briefly discuss Bradley’s thoughts on statistics in general, and on the need to recruit young people.</p>
<p>Statistics occupies a unique position as a discipline. It exists only as a tool used to study and interpret the data produced by other fields. It has no data that is essentially its own. Due to this place (or lack of place in a sense), statistics is often in danger of being overlooked, since it is rarely the focus of a study, and is used instead primarily as the means of data analysis as part of a larger research goal</p>
<p>While the dearth of new statisticians and Bradley’s views on that are now nearly 40 years old, I found his thoughts interesting, as there is always a need for new statisticians from every generation, and that demand is especially high right now. Specifically, among other things, he laments the lack of knowledge about the career opportunities for statistics majors and the poor quality of basic undergraduate statistics courses. I also wonder whether his observation that students who might have been prospective statistics majors were turning to computer science might not still be true today.</p>
<p>In 2002, in an attempt to identify challenges facing the statistical community a workshop was held at the request of the National Science Foundation. Fifty participants were selected for the workshop from diversified backgrounds in the profession of statistics in order to try to represent all aspects of the field. The workshop’s focus was twofold. It first addressed what has been called the Statistical core which comprises of statistical activity focused inward on the subject of Statistics itself. Second, the focus was on applications of statistics and the main areas in which statistics is applied.
Overall the field is in a very good place. The profession itself is growing tremendously. This is due to a reevaluation of its importance along with the advent of big data and increased computing speed. Along with that, demand for statistics is growing in the sciences as these fields need statistics to analyze many of the world’s processes. The core itself is growing and changing and in 2001 a new statistical method was created through interplay and collaboration between two statisticians which allow astrophysicists to gather more evidence on the beginning of the universe. This core activity is highly crucial as the more statisticians work on the foundations of their field, the more easily they will be able to extend themselves to other fields with this firm foundation. Some challenges facing the core are scales of data and data compression. These were created with the advent of big data providing statisticians with almost too much information. Looking at statistics’ impact on other fields it can be seen that it is making a very large impact. Each field has its own set of problems to solve, but with increasing interest and support in the field, the future looks bright.</p>
