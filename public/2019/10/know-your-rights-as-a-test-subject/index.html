<p>While the advent of scientific experiments has provided countless contributions to mankind, it is important that ethics get highly considered before the conduction of such experiments. After numerous atrocities were committed during WWII including the use of human subjects, the Nuremberg code was drafted to impose guidelines upon physicians and scientists as to how to treat their subjects. The three main sections of this code include: the distinction between research and practice, a discussion of the three basic principles of ethics, and the applications of these principles.
After the adoption of this code and its guidelines, experiments have generally become drastically more ethical and safe for human subjects. Though the Nuremberg code was not perfect, many of its standards still stand today, while others have been slightly tweaked.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860367/">Related article on boundaries regarding human test subjects in biomedical research</a></p>
<p>Scientific research has provided numerous benefits to society as a whole, but public attention was brought to the issue of ethical treatment of human subjects in scientific research after the human testing done by Nazi scientists on concentration camp victims was made known to the rest of the world. During the Nuremberg War Crime Trials, the Nuremberg code was created to provide rules, both general and specific, for investigators and reviewers of research to abide by when testing the ethical practices of researchers using human subjects. A statement has been made, with three basic principles contained within, to guide scientists, subjects, reviewers, and interested citizens on research involving human subjects. The three facets of this statement are: the distinction between research and practice, a discussion of the three basic principles of ethics, and words about the applications of these principles.
First, drawing the line between research and practice. This line is often blurred because both often occur together, and because notable departures from standard practice are labelled “experimental”, when the line between “experimental” and “research” are unclear. Generally, “practice” refers to specific treatments that have the sole purpose of helping the individual client or patient, and have a reasonable expectation of success. The term “research” refers to an activity designed to test a hypothesis, draw conclusions from the activity, and contribute to general knowledge. When a procedure is labelled “experimental”, this does not mean it is always done in a research capacity. However, this new procedure should be included in some form of formal research at some early point in order to determine the safety and effectiveness of the procedure. Research and practice can be done at the same time, when the research is done to test how safe and effective the practice is. The rule of thumb is that if the procedure has any element of research in it, it should go under review.
When talking about basic ethical principles in human test subjects, there are 3 basic ones that are particularly relevant to this topic: the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.
Respect for persons incorporates the idea that every person should be treated as having autonomy, and that people who have diminished autonomy deserve protection. An autonomous person is someone who is capable of considering personal goals, and acting under the direction determined by that consideration. Failing to respect that autonomy is failing to consider their individual convictions, denying them the freedom to act on those convictions, or withholding information needed to make an evaluated judgement. Not everyone is capable of this ability. This ability grows as a person matures, and a person can lose it due to illness, mental disability, or a situation that restricts their freedom. Some people need more protection than others. The length of protection should vary, depending on the potential benefit, and the risk of harm. An example where this becomes ambiguous is using prisoners in research, as on the one hand they should be allowed to make their own decisions, but on the other hand their freedom is restricted, and they could have been coerced into the situation.
Respect for beneficence is basically to say that when using human subjects, efforts should be made to maximize benefits and minimize or remove any harm that can befall them. However, sometimes in learning what causes harm, may cause harm to people. It must be decided whether the benefits gained by conducting this research with this potential harm outweigh the harm done by the research itself. Also to weigh is the individual benefits and harms from the research, and the larger scale benefits and harms that come with the gained knowledge of the research. That is to say, what may hurt the individual in the research may have a massive benefit to society as a whole. This principle of beneficence is present in research on children, in particular when the research presents more than minimal risk without direct benefit to the children being tested upon. It could help many children in the future, but is it worth the harm to the child in that moment?
Respect for justice in research is the question: “Who should receive the benefits of research, and who must bear the consequences?” There are several widely accepted just ways of distributing benefits, which are 1) each person gets an equal share, 2) each person based on personal need, 3) each person based on individual effort, 4) each person based on contribution to society, and 5) each person based on merit. This idea of justice was not always thought to apply to scientific research, but it is present in much of research’s history in the 19th and 20th centuries. For example, the Tuskegee syphilis project, where sharecroppers were denied treatment for syphilis even after it was widely available, in order to not tamper the study’s results, even though that disease was not specific to poor black men. The idea of justice in research is that subjects are chosen not for convenience, but rather their relevance to the subject being researched, and additionally, that the benefits of research should be made available to all people, not just those who can afford it.
Applications of these principles leads to deliberation of these requirements: informed consent, risk/benefit assessment, and the selection of subjects for research.
Informed consent stems from respect for persons. It is the idea that subjects can choose whether or not they participate in the study, and that they understand what the study can do for them and society. Three important aspects of informed consent are information, comprehension, and voluntariness. Information means that the subjects must be told what the study is about, who is conducting it, what they will have to do, etc. One issue with information arises when the subjects knowledge of the study can affect the results. In this situation, it is agreed that there should be no undisclosed risks other than minimal ones, there should be proof that if the subjects understand the study they truly will influence the results, and that there should be a plan to debriefing subjects and getting results to them as soon as possible. Comprehension basically just means that the information must be presented to the subject in a manner that the subject understands. Scientific jargon must be simplified for the subject. In the case where mental illness or injury prevents comprehension, consent of a trusted third party for the subject must be obtained, (ie a family member of a person in a coma), and that the third party also comprehends the risks and benefits. Voluntariness is very straightforward: the consent cannot be forced from the person, whether it be with threat of harm or with ludacris payments promised that may or may not be fulfilled.
Assessment of risks and benefits stems from the respect for beneficence. It is the process by which researchers and evaluators must weigh the benefits against the risks of the research at hand. When weighing the risks and benefits to society versus the risks and benefits of the individual subjects, the subjects are usually placed above society. It is often said that the “ratio” of benefits to risks must be “balanced”, usually systematically. The study should be evaluated to see if human subjects are even necessary. Risk/benefit analysis must be incredibly thorough for any research involving human subjects.
Finally, the selection of subjects stems from the respect for justice. The idea is that researchers don’t pick subjects based on any criteria other than relevance to the study. No cultural biases whatsoever should be included. Human subjects should be chosen if they will receive benefits from the study directly. Even despite researchers best intentions, unjust social biases can make themselves present in the distribution of the benefits of research. While this may be unavoidable, at least the selection of research subjects should be done with justice in mind.</p>
