<p>“To understand God’s thoughts, we must understand statistics for these are the measure of His purpose” -Florence Nightengale</p>
<p>For our famous statistician we researched Florence Nightengale. Florence was born in Florence, Italy in 1820. She used statistics to improve her practice of nursing and in doing so became one of the founders of modern nursing. She kept records of every one of all her patients was known for using effective graphical representations of her data. Her ability to do so in an easy to understand way helped her spread her influence on the field of nursing. Through her data collection, Nightengale learned that poor sanitary practices were one of the main reasons for death in hospitals. In her lifetime, she went on to establish her own nursing school, hospital, and changed public perception of nursing.</p>
<p>Florence Nightengale was born in Florence, Italy on May 12, 1820. She was born into an affluent family, and her father believed she should be educated even though most women were not formally educated at the time. When she was a young girl, she enjoyed doing philanthropy. This led her to work in the field of nursing so she could help those who were injured or sick. In the 1850s, she moved to England where she significantly lowered the death rate at the hospital where she worked by improving sanitary conditions. In 1854, the Secretary of War in Britain sent her a letter asking her to organize a team of nurses to go help the British troops in Crimea. She sailed there with her team of 36 nurses and was shocked to see the hospital conditions there. More soldiers were dying from diseases rather than injuries from the war because of how bad the conditions were. Through her work, she was able to reduce the death rate by 66%. She became known as “lady with the lamp” because she would care for the soldiers in the evenings when it was dark. When she returned to Britain, she was gifted 250,000 dollars from the British government. With the money, she established St. Tomas’ Hospital and a nurse training school. Due to Nightengale’s pivotal impact on the field of medicine, nursing began to be seen as a noble job. When the US civil war began, she played a crucial role in teaching American nurses how to operate field hospitals.</p>
<p>Nightengale learned that poor sanitary practices were the main reason death rates were so high through her data collection and statistical analysis. Starting her work as a nurse, she collected statistical records of all the patients. She used her work to convince people that certain hospital practices were unsafe. By applying her work in statistics her medical practice, she was able to save thousands of lives. She created what is known as the “coxcomb”. It looks like a pie chart, and is divided into 12 slices, each representing a month of the year. Each slice was shaded to represent the death rate that month. She color coded the graph to show the cause of death. Nightengale made data look beautiful and understandable to others who didn’t know how to read statistical data. This aided Nightengale in teaching others how and why they should use her new and improved medical practices.</p>
<p>Nightengale was a trailblazer in the field of statistics. Her work allowed led to safer hospital conditions, become an inspiration to other women who wanted to get into nursing, and change the public perception of nursing.</p>
