      <title>Clinical trials revolution could change the future of medical research</title>

      <description>As it turns out, clinical trials aren’t so clinical after all. Not what you would expect, right? The primary reason for this is the manipulation of test results by researchers that is encouraged by many academic journals, as they typically have a strong preference of publishing positive test results - those that show a treatment works better than previous ones - rather than those that are negative - those that show a treatment doesn’t work or isn’t as effective as previous ones.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The National Research Act for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was signed into law in 1974, and without this act today, many more individuals may have passed away due to violation of basic human ethics in research experiments. The focus of this act revolved rules regarding human experiments, such as having respect for persons, beneficence, and justice Research experiments have previously targeted powerless individuals, so this act marked huge progress in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>While the advent of scientific experiments has provided countless contributions to mankind, it is important that ethics get highly considered before the conduction of such experiments. After numerous atrocities were committed during WWII including the use of human subjects, the Nuremberg code was drafted to impose guidelines upon physicians and scientists as to how to treat their subjects. The three main sections of this code include: the distinction between research and practice, a discussion of the three basic principles of ethics, and the applications of these principles.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Stanford Prison Experiment was a study conducted by Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford psychologist who ran the study at Stanford University in 1971. It is a controversial experiment that tried to draw conclusions about human power dynamics by assigning paid volunteers either the role of “inmate” or “guard” in a fake prison at the University.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Many of the most famous studies and experiments of the past years have lacked the ethics to provide real insight into the topics at hand
“I can list so many more textbook psychology findings that have either not replicated, or are currently in the midst of a serious reevaluation.”- Brian Resnick

Of the numerous studies conducted over the past few decades, the Stanford Prison Experiment has to be one of the most famous.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis revolves around the importance of ethics in human experiments. In this study, 600 African men were recruited, 201 without syphilis and 399 with the disease, after being promised access to medical care for free. Despite promises of free medical care, the men were only given placebos, even when penicillin became available as a treatment in 1947 in order to continue with the experiment, which aimed to track the progression of Syphilis in those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For 40 years, the U.S. Public Health Service has conducted a study in which human guinea pigs, not given proper treatment, have died of syphilis and its side effects”
- Jean Heller&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Think that you are safe from Big Brother? Think again. In a world where we protect ourselves, our personal belongings, and our loved ones, we are unable to protect a vital part of our lives – our online information. Nowadays, everything we do on the internet can be tracked and recorded. Over the years, online users have been manipulated and exploited by companies such as Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. These companies have gathered and used our information such as the sites we look at or the things we buy for their own experimentation and data analysis.</description>

&lt;p&gt;A researcher has resigned from his position at the University of Cornell due to many of his studies being redacted for faulty research practices. Brain Wansink is being removed from his once prominent position as director for Cornell’ Food and Brand Lab, where he was considered an eating behavior expert. Wansink’s offenses that include “missreporting of research data, problematic statistical techniques, failure to properly document and preserve research results, and inappropriate authorship,” said Michael I. Kotlikoff, another senior researcher at Cornell.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hadley Wickham was born in the city of Hamilton, New Zealand, in 1979. He started his statistics career at a young age when, at 15, he developed Microsoft Access Databases that the company still uses today. Statistics runs in the Wickham family; his father has a PhD in statistics and his sister Charlotte is an assistant professor of statistics at Oregon State University. Wickham switched gears and received a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of Auckland, NZ.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In many instances, learn by doing can be a good thing, giving people the opportunity to
experience things firsthand. On the other hand, there are times where it is best to avoid events
that may have a negative impact. This is particularly true in the practice of statistics and the
publishing of data. Instead of making these avoidable mistakes, Howard Wainer has saved us the
trouble by providing twelve rules in his article, How to Display Data Badly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Approval of Trump&#39;s Impeachment really Improving?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Have you read headlines about impeachment, or Donald Trump’s approval rating going down? This article captures the statistics behind presidential popularity and all the biases that often surround it. For instance, differential nonresponse bias may be causing an appearance of increased support for impeachment, when in reality public perception has not changed. The survey method used to draw opinion results are flawed in that the responses vary by the means of who is responding and who is not - an error pollsters still have to work on in order to “cancel out” the nonresponse bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you guys tired of the same boring graphs to represent data? Well, Charles Joseph Minard in 1869 certainly was. To represent Napoleon sending 400,000 troops out to attack Russia in response to Czar Alexander of Russia refusing to adhere to Napoleon’s embargo on the UK, Minard used an elegant graph depicting not only the number of troops, but also temperature and the path of the march over a map of Europe. Rather than simply showing data, Minard had a focus on story-telling which would inspire statisticians for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In the article “Analyzing Minard’s Visualization of Napoleon’s 1812 March,” Joanne Cheng conducts a data analysis on Minard’s graphic of Napoleon in Russia. Cheng states that Edward Tufte calls this graphic one of the “best statistical drawings ever created,” so Cheng conducted the data analysis to figure out why it is such a good graphic. The data analysis covers Napoleon and his troops’ journey into Russia and eventually Moscow in 1812, as the title indicates.</description>

      <title>Null Results</title>

      <description>In today’s scientific studies, researchers are becoming increasingly selective in what results they choose to write about and even more selective in what they publish. In his article “Why null results rarely see the light of day”, Jeffery Mervis details the prominent issue of bias toward writing and publishing strong results over null results in modern research while acknowledging the potential dangers of overemphasizing the publication of null results.In recent times, it has been overtly evident that social science experiments have been heavily in favor of writing and publication of strong results.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are always looking for exciting results. Whether it be a study about the link between global warming and the frequency of hurricanes, or a new drug that could be effective in curing cancer, scientists or corporations behind the studies would prefer the more exciting results. Researchers want their experiments to prove something under question or shed light on a new topic rather than showing a null result, either supporting a past study or showing no correlation between the variables. Studies with null results go unpublished nearly 80% of the time, a situation that has become known as the “file drawer” phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

A few times a year, I get asked to be a judge of student statistical projects in politics or sports. While the students are very bright, they spend WAY too much time using fancy statistical methods and not enough time framing the right questions and contextualizing their answers.
