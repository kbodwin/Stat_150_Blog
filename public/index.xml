&lt;p&gt;The field of statistics is certainly wide open to women. If you are willing to take the mathematics and science courses and then work very hard … there are all sorts of opportunities to go as far as you wish. - Gertrude Cox&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Display Data Badly</title>

&lt;p&gt;In many instances, learn by doing can be a good thing, giving people the opportunity to
experience things firsthand. On the other hand, there are times where it is best to avoid events
that may have a negative impact. This is particularly true in the practice of statistics and the
publishing of data. Instead of making these avoidable mistakes, Howard Wainer has saved us the
trouble by providing twelve rules in his article, How to Display Data Badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you guys tired of the same boring graphs to represent data? Well, Charles Joseph Minard in 1869 certainly was. To represent Napoleon sending 400,000 troops out to attack Russia in response to Czar Alexander of Russia refusing to adhere to Napoleon’s embargo on the UK, Minard used an elegant graph depicting not only the number of troops, but also temperature and the path of the march over a map of Europe. Rather than simply showing data, Minard had a focus on story-telling which would inspire statisticians for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Null Results</title>

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are always looking for exciting results. Whether it be a study about the link between global warming and the frequency of hurricanes, or a new drug that could be effective in curing cancer, scientists or corporations behind the studies would prefer the more exciting results. Researchers want their experiments to prove something under question or shed light on a new topic rather than showing a null result, either supporting a past study or showing no correlation between the variables. Studies with null results go unpublished nearly 80% of the time, a situation that has become known as the “file drawer” phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.”― Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes

A few times a year, I get asked to be a judge of student statistical projects in politics or sports. While the students are very bright, they spend WAY too much time using fancy statistical methods and not enough time framing the right questions and contextualizing their answers.
