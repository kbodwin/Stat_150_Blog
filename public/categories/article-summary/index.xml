      <description>Learning statistics should be prioritized before studying calculus.
Ever wonder when calculus is actually going to be useful? Most schools design math classes in a way that builds up to the idea of calculus; calculus may not be useful for everyone. Arthur Benjamin, in his TED Talk “Teach Statistics Before Calculus,” advocates for placing priority on the education of statistics over calculus. Of course for students in the field of math, science, engineering, or economics, calculus is essential class to take, but others may find the study irrelevant in their daily lives.</description>

&lt;h2&gt;Blurb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this TED talk, Professor Arthur Benjamin of Harvey Mudd University describes his thoughts on mathematics curriculum and how it’s attachment to calculus is somewhat archaic, and a newer more useful approach would be to focus on statistics and a more modern and concrete approach to mathematics using statistics and data.

      <title>Clinical trials revolution could change the future of medical research</title>

      <description>As it turns out, clinical trials aren’t so clinical after all. Not what you would expect, right? The primary reason for this is the manipulation of test results by researchers that is encouraged by many academic journals, as they typically have a strong preference of publishing positive test results - those that show a treatment works better than previous ones - rather than those that are negative - those that show a treatment doesn’t work or isn’t as effective as previous ones.</description>
