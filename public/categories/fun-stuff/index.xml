      <description>At 805 Kitchen, to spice up your waffle, DO NOT grab toppings from the yogurt bar (chocolate chips, coconut flakes, etc) and add it into your waffle batter before cooking your waffle. There have been reports of severe allergic reactions where the ambulance has been required to come according to staff working there. If you want to up your waffle game, then please do it afterwards and simply add it to the finished waffle product.</description>

      <description>&#34;We need to stop teaching abstinence-only statistics, telling students they can only do it if they are in a committed relationship with a statistician. But all their friends are out there doing statistics and having a great time.
We need to teach safe stats.&#34;

A few times a year, I get asked to be a judge of student statistical projects in politics or sports. While the students are very bright, they spend WAY too much time using fancy statistical methods and not enough time framing the right questions and contextualizing their answers.
