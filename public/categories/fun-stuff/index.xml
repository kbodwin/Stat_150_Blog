      <description>If you lose a personal item somewhere on campus, you can go to https://afd.calpoly.edu/facilities/services/lost-and-found and file a lost item report.
If they do not have your item, seek out the head of whichever building you lost the item in.
For example, if you lost an item in our Statistics classroom (Room 123A of building 38), you go to the ethics department office located south of our classroom on the first floor.</description>

      <description>&#34;We need to stop teaching abstinence-only statistics, telling students they can only do it if they are in a committed relationship with a statistician. But all their friends are out there doing statistics and having a great time.
We need to teach safe stats.&#34;
― Hadley Wickham

      <description>Challenge accepted! Here is a transition between surface area of US counties and their associated population. This arguably provides a much more accurate reading of the situation. @observablehq notebook: https://t.co/wdfMeV5hO4 #HowChartsLie #DataViz #d3js https://t.co/lStHeeuMUw pic.twitter.com/MpYiXtsHmu— Karim Douïeb (@karim_douieb) October 8, 2019</description>

A few times a year, I get asked to be a judge of student statistical projects in politics or sports. While the students are very bright, they spend WAY too much time using fancy statistical methods and not enough time framing the right questions and contextualizing their answers.
