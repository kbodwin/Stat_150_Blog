&lt;p&gt;The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis revolves around the importance of ethics in human experiments. In this study, 600 African men were recruited, 201 without syphilis and 399 with the disease, after being promised access to medical care for free. Despite promises of free medical care, the men were only given placebos, even when penicillin became available as a treatment in 1947 in order to continue with the experiment, which aimed to track the progression of Syphilis in those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For 40 years, the U.S. Public Health Service has conducted a study in which human guinea pigs, not given proper treatment, have died of syphilis and its side effects”
- Jean Heller&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>This data study proves that some academics don’t know how p-values are significant. Get it? Significant? A group of students from the University of Valencia in Spain conducted a study to show the importance of the p-value in academic psychologist research. In their study, they wanted to see how often p-values are misinterpreted; by looking at the outcomes of a test given, they noticed that there are many ways to misinterpret p-values.</description>
