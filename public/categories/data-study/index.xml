      <description>The data study included two articles this week, the first being a 1982 article by Ralph Bradley. Bradley speaks about the important future in the field and the need for new, young statisticians to support the ever-growing field. He spoke about the need to keep statistics relevant to current real-life applications and how good training will be important as statistics will reach more fields than ever as technology progresses. The second article was from 2002 where the National Science Foundation where they examined the field of statistics as a whole where they found the field was expanding well and growing into many new fields.</description>

      <description>Do vaccines cause autism? In a study published in 2009, Jeffrey Gerber and Paul Offit try to determine if the components in a vaccine result in increased rates of autism. They conclude the research by assessing a variety of hypothesizes individually. Stick around to see if the vaccinations impact social skills, neurological behavior, and communication.

      <description>“What is the truth behind hiring bias? Does it exist, and if so how prevalent is it? Through the statistics of resume names, we are somewhat closer to the truth.”
Racism and discrimination are still prevalent topics in today’s society. The effects of both reach almost all aspects of life. One of those aspects is the job market. Historically, companies were more likely to hire someone with a white sounding name over someone ca with a black sounding name.</description>

      <description>Many of the most famous studies and experiments of the past years have lacked the ethics to provide real insight into the topics at hand
“I can list so many more textbook psychology findings that have either not replicated, or are currently in the midst of a serious reevaluation.”- Brian Resnick

      <title>Data Ethics and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study</title>

&lt;p&gt;The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis revolves around the importance of ethics in human experiments. In this study, 600 African men were recruited, 201 without syphilis and 399 with the disease, after being promised access to medical care for free. Despite promises of free medical care, the men were only given placebos, even when penicillin became available as a treatment in 1947 in order to continue with the experiment, which aimed to track the progression of Syphilis in those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For 40 years, the U.S. Public Health Service has conducted a study in which human guinea pigs, not given proper treatment, have died of syphilis and its side effects”
- Jean Heller&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Misunderstanding of p-values</title>
      <link>/2019/10/misunderstanding-of-p-values/</link>

      <guid>/2019/10/misunderstanding-of-p-values/</guid>
      <description>This data study proves that some academics don’t know how p-values are significant. Get it? Significant? A group of students from the University of Valencia in Spain conducted a study to show the importance of the p-value in academic psychologist research. In their study, they wanted to see how often p-values are misinterpreted; by looking at the outcomes of a test given, they noticed that there are many ways to misinterpret p-values.</description>
