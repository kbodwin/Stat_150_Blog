&lt;p&gt;It may come as a shock that one of Harvard’s most notable statistic professors did not learn english as his first language. In fact, Xiao-Li Meng didn’t even acquire his B.S. in America. Neither of these facts have hindered Meng. He’s had over 300 seminars, written over 150 publications, and has earned 2 major awards. This is just a short list of his accomplishments and the ways he has utilized and applied the field of statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Statistics: Your chance for happiness (or misery)”
- Xiao-Li Meng&lt;/p&gt;
