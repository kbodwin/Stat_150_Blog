      <description>“The rule of law can be wiped out in one misguided, however, well intentioned, generation”-William Gosset
 Although William Sealy Gosset is one of the least known contributors to modern statistics, his work is still widely referenced today. He was born in Canterbury, England on June 13, 1876 to Agnes Sealy Vidal and Colonel Frederic Gosset. Gosset attended Winchester College before studying chemistry and mathematics at Oxford.</description>

      <description>“We really are facing a problem where there is to much data, but not enough tools to analyze the data.”- Daniela Witten
Your writeup here:
Daniela Witten is a professor at the University of Washinton. She went to school at Stanford University where she majored in Mathematics and Biological Science. A year later, she graduated and received her master’s in Statistics. Since then, she has written a statistic textbook called “An Introduction to Statistical Learning,” which has been widely used by students.</description>

      <title>Is Statistics More Important Than Calculus?</title>

      <description>Learning statistics should be prioritized before studying calculus.
Ever wonder when calculus is actually going to be useful? Most schools design math classes in a way that builds up to the idea of calculus; calculus may not be useful for everyone. Arthur Benjamin, in his TED Talk “Teach Statistics Before Calculus,” advocates for placing priority on the education of statistics over calculus. Of course for students in the field of math, science, engineering, or economics, calculus is essential class to take, but others may find the study irrelevant in their daily lives.</description>

      <description>While the advent of scientific experiments has provided countless contributions to mankind, it is important that ethics get highly considered before the conduction of such experiments. After numerous atrocities were committed during WWII including the use of human subjects, the Nuremberg code was drafted to impose guidelines upon physicians and scientists as to how to treat their subjects. The three main sections of this code include: the distinction between research and practice, a discussion of the three basic principles of ethics, and the applications of these principles.</description>

      <description>Have you ever read something that suspiciously links a certain medicine or food or something random to a serious medical condition? As patients, we’re taught that people in the medical field are trustworthy; however, some release very suspicious and questionable research conclusions that are complete frauds. John Carlisle is a statistical researcher and consultant anaesthetist working to help find and debunk fraud in medical research. In the following article, there is a conversation about major incidents of research frauds and how researchers like Carlisle are using statistics to seek out the red flags of sketchy research practices.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Stanford Prison Experiment was a study conducted by Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford psychologist who ran the study at Stanford University in 1971. It is a controversial experiment that tried to draw conclusions about human power dynamics by assigning paid volunteers either the role of “inmate” or “guard” in a fake prison at the University.&lt;/p&gt;

For our famous statistician we researched Florence Nightengale. Florence was born in Florence, Italy in 1820. She used statistics to improve her practice of nursing and in doing so became one of the founders of modern nursing. She kept records of every one of all her patients was known for using effective graphical representations of her data.</description>

&lt;p&gt;A researcher has resigned from his position at the University of Cornell due to many of his studies being redacted for faulty research practices. Brain Wansink is being removed from his once prominent position as director for Cornell’ Food and Brand Lab, where he was considered an eating behavior expert. Wansink’s offenses that include “missreporting of research data, problematic statistical techniques, failure to properly document and preserve research results, and inappropriate authorship,” said Michael I. Kotlikoff, another senior researcher at Cornell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you guys tired of the same boring graphs to represent data? Well, Charles Joseph Minard in 1869 certainly was. To represent Napoleon sending 400,000 troops out to attack Russia in response to Czar Alexander of Russia refusing to adhere to Napoleon’s embargo on the UK, Minard used an elegant graph depicting not only the number of troops, but also temperature and the path of the march over a map of Europe. Rather than simply showing data, Minard had a focus on story-telling which would inspire statisticians for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/2019/10/null-results/</guid>
      <description>In today’s scientific studies, researchers are becoming increasingly selective in what results they choose to write about and even more selective in what they publish. In his article “Why null results rarely see the light of day”, Jeffery Mervis details the prominent issue of bias toward writing and publishing strong results over null results in modern research while acknowledging the potential dangers of overemphasizing the publication of null results.In recent times, it has been overtly evident that social science experiments have been heavily in favor of writing and publication of strong results.</description>

      <description>An understanding of statistics is necessary to be able to correctly interpret the data we see and understand it’s validity. However, there are many common misunderstandings surrounding statistics and probability. Without an understanding of the validity of findings, people, even those who have been taught introductory statistics, can be led to false conclusions with real world consequences.
Responsible Statistic Education and Common Misinterpretations
Statistics used to be a small area of study, reserved for researchers to analyze their results.</description>

      <description>San Francisco, Oakland-Berkeley and to a lesser extent San Mateo County have been outperforming the rest of the Bay Area since spring, according to Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst with the Compass real estate brokerage. “My best guess is that the differentiating factor (in these markets) is all the IPOs that have occurred over the last six months,” he said — even though it wasn’t “the hysterical jump” in prices that some were anticipating.</description>
