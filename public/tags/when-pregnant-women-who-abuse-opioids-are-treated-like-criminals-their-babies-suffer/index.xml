      <description>Pregnant mother abuses opioids, punish her: seems reasonable, right?, especially considering the opioid epidemic that is ongoing in the United States and showing no signs of slowing down. The way this punishment is being carried out is by either criminalizing the mother or removing the baby from the mother. However, new data that is contained in this article clearly shows that this only makes things worse, as it pushes mothers dealing with opioid addiction into the shadows and away from the help they desperately need, and significantly increases the number of newborns who contend with drug withdrawal and thus is not beneficial for either the baby or the mother.</description>
