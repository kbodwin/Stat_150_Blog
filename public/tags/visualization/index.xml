&lt;p&gt;In many instances, learn by doing can be a good thing, giving people the opportunity to
experience things firsthand. On the other hand, there are times where it is best to avoid events
that may have a negative impact. This is particularly true in the practice of statistics and the
publishing of data. Instead of making these avoidable mistakes, Howard Wainer has saved us the
trouble by providing twelve rules in his article, How to Display Data Badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you guys tired of the same boring graphs to represent data? Well, Charles Joseph Minard in 1869 certainly was. To represent Napoleon sending 400,000 troops out to attack Russia in response to Czar Alexander of Russia refusing to adhere to Napoleon’s embargo on the UK, Minard used an elegant graph depicting not only the number of troops, but also temperature and the path of the march over a map of Europe. Rather than simply showing data, Minard had a focus on story-telling which would inspire statisticians for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
