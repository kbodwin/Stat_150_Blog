      <description>At 805 Kitchen, to spice up your waffle, DO NOT grab toppings from the yogurt bar (chocolate chips, coconut flakes, etc) and add it into your waffle batter before cooking your waffle. There have been reports of severe allergic reactions where the ambulance has been required to come according to staff working there. If you want to up your waffle game, then please do it afterwards and simply add it to the finished waffle product.</description>
