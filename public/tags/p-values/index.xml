      <description>This data study proves that some academics don’t know how p-values are significant. Get it? Significant? A group of students from the University of Valencia in Spain conducted a study to show the importance of the p-value in academic psychologist research. In their study, they wanted to see how often p-values are misinterpreted; by looking at the outcomes of a test given, they noticed that there are many ways to misinterpret p-values.</description>

      <description>In today’s scientific studies, researchers are becoming increasingly selective in what results they choose to write about and even more selective in what they publish. In his article “Why null results rarely see the light of day”, Jeffery Mervis details the prominent issue of bias toward writing and publishing strong results over null results in modern research while acknowledging the potential dangers of overemphasizing the publication of null results.In recent times, it has been overtly evident that social science experiments have been heavily in favor of writing and publication of strong results.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are always looking for exciting results. Whether it be a study about the link between global warming and the frequency of hurricanes, or a new drug that could be effective in curing cancer, scientists or corporations behind the studies would prefer the more exciting results. Researchers want their experiments to prove something under question or shed light on a new topic rather than showing a null result, either supporting a past study or showing no correlation between the variables. Studies with null results go unpublished nearly 80% of the time, a situation that has become known as the “file drawer” phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
