&lt;p&gt;“Banning p-values as a way to reduce irreproducibility in science is like banning strep tests as a way to reduce the prevalence of strep. As in, it does not work”

      <description>“Be approximately right rather than exactly wrong.”
John Tukey was an American statistician of the mid 1900’s who played a significant role in introducing concepts and terminology used in modern statistics. Born in 1915, Tukey was homeschooled by both his parents who were teachers. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in chemistry at Brown University and a Master’s Degree a year later. He then attended Princeton University to study mathematics and obtained his Ph.</description>

&lt;h2&gt;Blurb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this TED talk, Professor Arthur Benjamin of Harvey Mudd University describes his thoughts on mathematics curriculum and how it’s attachment to calculus is somewhat archaic, and a newer more useful approach would be to focus on statistics and a more modern and concrete approach to mathematics using statistics and data.

      <title>Clinical trials revolution could change the future of medical research</title>

      <description>As it turns out, clinical trials aren’t so clinical after all. Not what you would expect, right? The primary reason for this is the manipulation of test results by researchers that is encouraged by many academic journals, as they typically have a strong preference of publishing positive test results - those that show a treatment works better than previous ones - rather than those that are negative - those that show a treatment doesn’t work or isn’t as effective as previous ones.</description>

Florence Nightingale is a prominent figure in the nursing world, well known for her work during the Crimean war and for founding the first professional nursing school in the world. Nightingale worked with the British government to improve sanitation in field hospitals, while also improving nutrition and acquiring more medical supplies for the soldiers.</description>

      <title>Human Research Ethics and The Belmont Report</title>

&lt;p&gt;The National Research Act for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was signed into law in 1974, and without this act today, many more individuals may have passed away due to violation of basic human ethics in research experiments. The focus of this act revolved rules regarding human experiments, such as having respect for persons, beneficence, and justice Research experiments have previously targeted powerless individuals, so this act marked huge progress in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Many of the most famous studies and experiments of the past years have lacked the ethics to provide real insight into the topics at hand
“I can list so many more textbook psychology findings that have either not replicated, or are currently in the midst of a serious reevaluation.”- Brian Resnick

Of the numerous studies conducted over the past few decades, the Stanford Prison Experiment has to be one of the most famous.</description>

      <title>Data Ethics and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study</title>

&lt;p&gt;The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis revolves around the importance of ethics in human experiments. In this study, 600 African men were recruited, 201 without syphilis and 399 with the disease, after being promised access to medical care for free. Despite promises of free medical care, the men were only given placebos, even when penicillin became available as a treatment in 1947 in order to continue with the experiment, which aimed to track the progression of Syphilis in those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For 40 years, the U.S. Public Health Service has conducted a study in which human guinea pigs, not given proper treatment, have died of syphilis and its side effects”
- Jean Heller&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Think that you are safe from Big Brother? Think again. In a world where we protect ourselves, our personal belongings, and our loved ones, we are unable to protect a vital part of our lives – our online information. Nowadays, everything we do on the internet can be tracked and recorded. Over the years, online users have been manipulated and exploited by companies such as Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. These companies have gathered and used our information such as the sites we look at or the things we buy for their own experimentation and data analysis.</description>

https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/health/a29343883/vaping-illness-epidemic-cdc-director-interview/
It appears that a long-existing act that has more recently gained a surge in popularity has finally been connected to some terrifying consequences. The article above focuses on an interview between the media and Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, who appears to be prominently concerned about the alarming number of cases involving repeated usage of vape products.</description>

Neither of these facts have hindered Meng. He’s had over 300 seminars, written over 150 publications, and has earned 2 major awards. This is just a short list of his accomplishments and the ways he has utilized and applied the field of statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many instances, learn by doing can be a good thing, giving people the opportunity to
experience things firsthand. On the other hand, there are times where it is best to avoid events
that may have a negative impact. This is particularly true in the practice of statistics and the
publishing of data. Instead of making these avoidable mistakes, Howard Wainer has saved us the
trouble by providing twelve rules in his article, How to Display Data Badly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Have you read headlines about impeachment, or Donald Trump’s approval rating going down? This article captures the statistics behind presidential popularity and all the biases that often surround it. For instance, differential nonresponse bias may be causing an appearance of increased support for impeachment, when in reality public perception has not changed. The survey method used to draw opinion results are flawed in that the responses vary by the means of who is responding and who is not - an error pollsters still have to work on in order to “cancel out” the nonresponse bias.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In the article “Analyzing Minard’s Visualization of Napoleon’s 1812 March,” Joanne Cheng conducts a data analysis on Minard’s graphic of Napoleon in Russia. Cheng states that Edward Tufte calls this graphic one of the “best statistical drawings ever created,” so Cheng conducted the data analysis to figure out why it is such a good graphic. The data analysis covers Napoleon and his troops’ journey into Russia and eventually Moscow in 1812, as the title indicates.</description>

      <description>This data study proves that some academics don’t know how p-values are significant. Get it? Significant? A group of students from the University of Valencia in Spain conducted a study to show the importance of the p-value in academic psychologist research. In their study, they wanted to see how often p-values are misinterpreted; by looking at the outcomes of a test given, they noticed that there are many ways to misinterpret p-values.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are always looking for exciting results. Whether it be a study about the link between global warming and the frequency of hurricanes, or a new drug that could be effective in curing cancer, scientists or corporations behind the studies would prefer the more exciting results. Researchers want their experiments to prove something under question or shed light on a new topic rather than showing a null result, either supporting a past study or showing no correlation between the variables. Studies with null results go unpublished nearly 80% of the time, a situation that has become known as the “file drawer” phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
