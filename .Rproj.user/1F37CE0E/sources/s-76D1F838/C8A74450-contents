- 10% Homework assignments
- 15% Labs
- 25% Group blog contributions and presentations
- 10% Midterm
- 20% Final
- 10% Participation and attendance

## Class Blog

Every week, on Monday, your group and individual work from the previous week will be shared in the form of a class blog.

The current blog can be found here:  [www.stat150.blog](www.stat150.blog)

You are expected to read the blogs for **both** sections of Stat 150 each week, and you are encouraged (but not required) to comment on the posts regularly.  Your weekly homework assignments will include some questions about these blog posts, to insure that you engage with them.

## Group Work

Throughout the quarter, you will work with a group of your classmates.  **Every week**, your group will be expected to submit one of the sections of the class blog, and some accompanying material.

The group-submitted blog sections are:

1. Famous Historical Statistician
2. Famous Modern Statistician
3. Statistics in the News
4. Ethics of Data
5. Article of the Week
6. Data Analysis of the week


## Homework

Homework assignments are due by **Sunday night at midnight**.  They are always assigned on PolyLearn, in the form of a quiz.

Homework questions will relate to the weekly blog and weekly reading, and sometimes they will ask you to learn a new Cal Poly skill.

## Labs

Every **Wednesday**, we will work together in class using **R**.

You will be asked to complete small data analysis assignments, with the possibility for Flex Points if you go above and beyond the requirements of the assignment.

Completed labs are due **Sunday at midnight** on PolyLearn.

### Laptops

You **must** have a laptop for Wednesday Lab days. 

If you do not own one, you may borrow one from the library.

Chromebooks will **not** be sufficient to use **R**.

## Exams

This course has a **midterm exam** (10%) and a **final exam** (20%).

These exams will cover material from the class blog and readings in class, as well as a small amount of data visualization with R.

The midterm exam is a written, in-class exam.  The final exam will be a take-home assignment.

### Dates

**Midterm:** Wednesday, October 30th

**Final Exam: (Take-home)** Due Friday, December 13th

## Participation and Attendance

Because this class is meant to introduce you to your peers and your academic community, attendance is an important part of the course.  You are expected to be in class every Monday and Wednesday, and to be prepared for discussions and presentations.

Participation will be interpreted broadly.  Speaking up in class is one form of participation, but it is not for everyone.  Comments on the class blog, extra effort in presentations and submissions, and attendance at offie hours will also contribute to your overall participation grade.

## Flex Points

This class is meant to be fun! As such, there are many nontraditional ways to contribute to the course.

10% of your grade will consist of "Flex Points".  These points will be totalled from your participation in many optional activities.

A current list of Flex Point opportunities can be found here:  https://rstudio.csm.calpoly.edu/Flex_Points/

## Other Policies

### Diversity and Inclusion

It is my goal for everyone to feel safe and comfortable in my classroom. If there is any way
I can make the course more welcoming for you, please do not hesitate to ask.

In particular, if you have a disability, I will gladly work with you to make this class accessible.

I encourage you to also contact the **Disability Resource Center** *(Building 124, Room 119
or at 805-756-1395)*, who can help you register for extra accomodations such as extended
exam time.

### Cheating and Plagiarism.

Simply put, I will not tolerate cheating. 

Any incident of dishonesty, copying, exam cheat-
ing, or plagiarism will be reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities.

Cheating will earn you a grade of 0 on the assignment and a grade penalty of at least 10%.

For more information about what constitutes cheating and plagiarism, please see
