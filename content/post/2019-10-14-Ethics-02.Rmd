  Think that you are safe from Big Brother? Think again. In a world where we protect ourselves, our personal belongings, and our loved ones, we are unable to protect a vital part of our lives -- our online information. Nowadays, everything we do on the internet can be tracked and recorded. Over the years, online users have been manipulated and exploited by companies such as Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. These companies have gathered and used our information such as the sites we look at or the things we buy for their own experimentation and data analysis. This has become a major ethical issue as people question how much information websites should be allowed to collect. Various solutions have been discussed, with a major solution being differential privacy. This would allow companies to conduct experiments and research on their users while keeping everything anonymous. In the meantime, however, it is important to determine if we are doing enough on a personal level to ensure that the privacy of ourselves and those closest to us is being protected to the best of our abilities.

   As technology has become so integrated into our daily lives, the issue of how to control it has naturally come up, and with it, how companies can do a better job of protecting users’ data and ultimately their privacy. Over the past couple of years, there have been several scandals that have led to discussions on whether or not privacy consent is what it seems to be, developing ethical guidelines and policies, and methods to protect user privacy.
   
  In 2018, Cambridge Analytica exploited millions of users’ Facebook profiles to target voters with personalized political advertisements. An important revelation was that the information collected was not just Facebook users but also their friends. This brings up the question of whether or not an individual’s legal consent follows with what they think they have morally consented. The Cambridge Analytica story reveals that even the privacy settings of one person affects the surrounding people. 
  
  The Facebook emotion experiment where they tested user response to various positive and negative posts on their feed as well as their voting reminders raises questions about the ethics of consent of such experiments and who is responsible for regulating these experiments. Mary L. Gray, from Microsoft Research has set up an ethics committee to guide researchers. She explains that “too often, researchers conducting digital experiments work in isolation with little outside guidance”. One issue with existing federal regulations in terms of experiments often involve physical human experiments, but digital human experiments are something that still needs to be refined.
  
  A new way of protecting privacy called differential privacy has been proposed, and it allows tech companies to gather user data without intruding on user privacy. It works by sharing data aggregated over time of multiple people instead of individual people’s personal information. This new model is useful because companies need data to improve user experience, but they also cannot collect too much and violate countries’ privacy policies. Just recently, a Belgian court threatened Facebook with a €250,000/day fine if they didn’t stop collecting data on users’ browsing habits on external sites. Differential privacy can be used to better protect user data while still allowing companies to utilize information to improve their product.
  
  With technology becoming increasingly more involved in our personal lives, user privacy and data tracking has become an important issue to discuss for users, companies and governments. It is important for everyone to collectively move towards making a safer, more protected digital world.
