<p>Karl Pearson served as a leading founder in the modern field of statistics. Born in 1857 in London, England, Pearson spent many of his early years following the religious beliefs of his Quaker ancestry and it wasn’t until his mid-twenties that he decided to lean away from that, opting instead to explore his academic interests while slowly becoming more of an agnostic. During his college years, he took a particular interest in pursuing the fields of philosophy, physics, and law. It’s worth noting as well that Pearson took a significant amount of interest in the aspects of Socialism and the philosophies of Karl Marx. It wasn’t until 1884 that Pearson’s contributions to the field of math and statistics really took shape as he was appointed professor of applied mathematics and mechanics at University.
While educating a wealth of engineering students, Pearson fully realized his passion for statistics, going so far as to write and publish “The Grammar of Science.” This book argued that the Scientific Method of the time was much more of a description of whatever information it was relaying rather than an explanation for how said information came to fruition. It was with this ideology that he was able to progress statistics forward and apply statistical reasoning to the studies of biological evolution and eugenics; two incredibly relevant topics of the era.
One of Pearson’s greatest contributions to the Statistical field of science materialized in his foundation of the first journal of modern statistics, “Biometrika.” In said journal, he and a team of highly trained professionals recorded all sorts of medical and educational data to derive and apply new ideas in statistics, including the chi-square distribution. For the remainder of his life after this, Pearson spent much of his time involving himself in bitter arguments with other statisticians and economists who he felt hadn’t mastered the material well enough to consider themselves experts. He later passed away in 1936.</p>
