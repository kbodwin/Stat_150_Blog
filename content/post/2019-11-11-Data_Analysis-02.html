<blockquote>
<p>“What is the truth behind hiring bias? Does it exist, and if so how prevalent is it? Through the statistics of resume names, we are somewhat closer to the truth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Racism and discrimination are still prevalent topics in today’s society. The effects of both reach almost all aspects of life. One of those aspects is the job market. Historically, companies were more likely to hire someone with a white sounding name over someone ca with a black sounding name. In studies today, the discrimination in the job market has declined slightly. All of these previous studies were on black versus white, but never hispanic versus white. In a study conducted by the University of Missouri, black names, hispanic names, and white names were compared. The researchers sent almost 9,000 resumes to online job postings. Black applicants had the last names of Washington or Jefferson. Hispanic applicants had the last names of Hernandez or Garcia. White applicants had the last names of Anderson or Thompson. The results of the study was that on average, 11.4% of the resumes received a response. There was no significant difference between ethnic groups, race, or gender. The results of the study are very positive, but co-author Cory Koedel warned to take the results of the study with a grain of salt. While the results are important, it is not enough to suggest that discrimination is solved and a problem of the past. This is due to several internal criticisms, such as names being a poor indicator of race. It is not common knowledge that “Washington” and “Jefferson” are last names that mostly belong to African Americans, especially since these names belonged to white US presidents. Furthermore, the first names attached to these “black” last names (like “Chloe” and “Ryan”) are actually very popular names among white children born throughout the late nineties. However, it is worth noting that these criticisms likely don’t apply to the Hispanic names used (Isabelle and Carlos for first names along with Garcia and Hernandez for last names) since they were more stereotypically Hispanic. Confounding variables could also have influenced the results, such as the location of the cities where the study was conducted and the credentials attached to the names. Finally, there are a few key takeaways from this article. One of them is that the impact of racism on hiring may be waning. However, the main takeaway from this study is that it is extremely difficult to design an experiment free of bias that gets to the answer of a problem. This must be taken into consideration when someone is designing or reviewing data from studies tackling complicated issues like the racial bias that may or may not exist in hiring.</p>
