<blockquote>
One of the attributes that has made me successful is that I am exquisitely sensitive to
frustration. - Hadley Wickham

Hadley Wickham is the Chief Scientist at RStudio and an Adjunct Professor of Statistics
at the University of Auckland, the birthplace of R (programming language), Stanford University,
and Rice University. He builds computational and cognitive tools that make data science more
efficient and fun. Wickham was born on October 14th, 1979, and is originally from Hamilton,
New Zealand. Currently, he lives in Houston, TX with his partner and dog. Wickham is best
known for the development of open-source statistical analysis software packages for R that
implements logics of data visualization and data transformation. His packages and writing are
known for advocating a tidy data approach to data import, analysis, and modelling methods.
Some of his packages, ggplot2, plyr and reshape, have become fundamental packages for most R
users. In addition, he is also the author of a collection of books on the topic of using R
effectively. He recently received the COPSS President Award for his outstanding and influential
contribution to the field of statistics. Wickham’s hobbies include baking and making cocktails.
Also, his sister, Charlotte Wickham, is an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Oregon State
University. Throughout his life, he has faced a multitude of barriers; from being a homosexual
male, to being in medical school for three years before realizing his interests lie in computer
science and statistics, Wickham persisted to becoming the best he could be and overcame his
obstacles.


Wickham on how he has been able to contribute to R as much as he has: 
<blockquote>
I have worked
really hard to build a solid writing habit. I try and write for 60-90 minutes every morning
[...] Writing also makes me aware of gaps in my knowledge and my tools, and filling in
those gaps tends to make me more efficient at tackling new problems
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I read a lot. I follow about 300 blogs, and keep a pretty close eye on the R tags on
Twitter and Stack Overflow…. But this wide exposure helps me keep up with changes in
technology, interesting new programming languages, and what others are doing with
data.”
