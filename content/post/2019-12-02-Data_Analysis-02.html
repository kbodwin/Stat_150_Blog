<p>Do vaccines cause autism? In a study published in 2009, Jeffrey Gerber and Paul Offit try to determine if the components in a vaccine result in increased rates of autism. They conclude the research by assessing a variety of hypothesizes individually. Stick around to see if the vaccinations impact social skills, neurological behavior, and communication.</p>
<p>This study, published on February 15 of 2009 by Jeffrey S. Gerber and Paul A. Offit, works to understand if vaccines increase the chances of having autism. To begin, there were three hypotheses that attempted to explain why vaccines cause autism that our two authors wished to test. The first hypothesis claimed that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccines causes autism by damaging the intestinal linings. The next hypothesis blamed thimerosal, a preservative found in some vaccines that is toxic to the central nervous system. Finally, the last hypothesis claimed to say the administration of multiple vaccines weakens the immune system which can lead to autism. The study explains the history/background of each hypothesis while using evidence to refute or support each one.</p>
<p>Responding to the first hypothesis, researchers didn’t find any data supporting an association between measles-mumps-rubella vaccines and autism. In England, about 5000 kids per month receive the MMR vaccine, and so coincidences are bound to happen. Some kids are bound to get autism, just by chance, not necessarily because of the vaccine. The measles vaccine was not found more in children with autism compared to children without autism. Thus, there were no differences in autism rates among kids who were vaccinated and kids who weren’t. The takeaway is that the MMR vaccine and autism are independent, and not associated.</p>
<p>Second, research studies have failed to support an association between thimerosal and autism. In Sweden and Denmark, rates of autism increased, even when thimerosal was removed from the vaccines. The risk of autism was found to be the same between children who were vaccinated with thimerosal and children who were not. Once again, there is no relationship between the two variables.</p>
<p>Lastly, the claim that multiple vaccines weaken the immune system is false. Vaccines don’t overwhelm a child’s immune system, as their immune systems can respond to multiple vaccines. Nor do they weaken the immune system; vaccines prevent children from certain diseases. Also, autism is not related to the immune system, so it is not logical to say that vaccines are associated with autism. In conclusion, numerous studies done all over the world, on hundreds of thousands of children, have proven that autism is not caused by vaccines.</p>
