<p>“We really are facing a problem where there is to much data, but not enough tools to analyze the data.”
- Daniela Witten</p>
<p>Your writeup here:</p>
<p>Daniela Witten is a professor at the University of Washinton. She went to school at Stanford University where she majored in Mathematics and Biological Science. A year later, she graduated and received her master’s in Statistics. Since then, she has written a statistic textbook called “An Introduction to Statistical Learning,” which has been widely used by students. Witten is making breaking new ground in the field of statistics by applying statistical machine learning processes to biomedical data to personalize medical treatments. Witten works on developing machine learning methods to apply to big data to make accurate deductions. Now, Witten is a professor at the University of Washington where she teaches Statistics and Biostatistics. Recently, Witten was celebrated by the American Statistical Association for being one of the top women in data science. Witten has pointed out that people often think that once enough data has been collected on a subject, a conclusion can made. Witten contends that this is often not true. Witten has emphasized that classically trained statisticians are still very important to make statistical applications that can be applied to the data to create more meaningful conclusions.</p>
