Pregnant mother abuses opioids, punish her: seems reasonable, right?, especially considering the opioid epidemic that is ongoing in the United States and showing no signs of slowing down. The way this punishment is being carried out is by either criminalizing the mother or removing the baby from the mother. However, new data that is contained in this article clearly shows that this only makes things worse, as it pushes mothers dealing with opioid addiction into the shadows and away from the help they desperately need, and significantly increases the number of newborns who contend with drug withdrawal and thus is not beneficial for either the baby or the mother. This piece of news fits in with the debate that has recently started to pick up steam that is whether or not drug use should continue to be criminalized, since many data studies such as this one clearly demonstrate that criminalization has many unintended negative consequences that treatment and rehab don't.

New research suggests that laws that criminalize pregnant women who abuse opioids are counterproductive to reducing the number of unhealthy babies. The research addresses NAS, short for neonatal abstinence syndrome, which is a group of conditions that occurs because their mothers took opioids during pregnancy resulting in the baby suffering withdrawal symptoms right after birth. The rate of opioid use disorder and babies born with NAS have risen dramatically in the past decade. As the opioid epidemic is a current topic, lawmakers are looking for ways to punish pregnant women with drug addictions. A study on how the type of laws affect NAS rates by Rand Corp was recently published in the journal JAMA Network Open. The study looks at data from 2003 through 2014 from eight states with laws that address drug abuse during pregnancy. Out of more than 4.5 million live births, the researchers identified 23,3777 newborns with NAS. Using this data, they compared rates of NAS for states before and after they adopted punitive laws, and they observed that in the first year, the rate of babies born with NAS rose by 24% from 46 in 10,000 to 57 per 10,000 live births. Of the states that required women to report births with NAS but without associated punitive measures, the rate of babies born with NAS remained the same. The research implies that policies that criminalize women or threaten to remove their babies drives them away from seeking treatment for addiction and thereby puts the babies at even greater harm. Essentially, laws that punish women with drug addiction does not lower rates of NAS but actually increases the rates. The American Society of Addiction Medicine advocates screening women for substance abuse and providing adequate resources and treatment. They say that removing the child from the mother is harmful to babies; instead, systems should be put in place in keeping the mother and child together while giving her opportunities to get treatment.

The data is helpful in providing quantitative support for the idea that punitive laws are actually harmful towards babies instead of reducing the rates of NAS. It provides valuable insight into exactly how much the rates has increased and establishes a correlation between punitive laws and an increase in babies with NAS. However, eight states is not a particularly large sample size even though the data goes over 4.5 millions live births comparing births from states with and without these laws. The article also does not establish which eight states were analyzed, so it is unknown whether the states are from one region or scattered throughout the United States. Various other factors may play a role in how pregnant women facing substance abuse manage their problems. The research should also consider other factors and laws such as state abortion regulations, the individual statesâ€™ laws on drug use, income levels, etc. The study could be improved by increasing the number of states sampled and addressing other possible variables.
