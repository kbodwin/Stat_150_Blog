Today, the rate at which people are being diagnosed with autism has been increasing. This has caused concern for many who believe that vaccines could potentially be causing autism. Keep on reading to learn about the different hypothesis on between vaccines and autism, and whether or not vaccines can cause autism.

Vaccines cause autism. We’ve all heard this claim before, but is there evidence to support it? The simple answer is: yes. However, the more truthful answer is: yes, but there is far more evidence refuting it. The anti-vaccination, or anti-vax for short, movement all began when a paper published in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield “described 8 children whose first symptoms of autism appeared within 1 month after receiving a [measles-mumps-rubella] vaccine.'' The paper postulated that the vaccine caused “intestinal inflammation” that sent peptides, or short chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, “to the bloodstream and, subsequently, to the brain,” where they,  “affected development”, or, in other words, caused autism. This study, while startling, was undermined by several issues. To name a few: There were no control subjects, the assessments were not blind, and the data was not collected systematically or completely.

Even despite the fraudulence of the study, parental fears of vaccines persisted. So, to address these fears, studies were performed in hopes of disproving the claims made by Wakefield. The goal of the first wave of these studies (1998-2004) was to disprove “an association between [MMR] vaccine and autism”. These studies were all observational and consisted of three different design types: ecological, case-control, prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort. Each type of study is nuanced and served a distinct purpose in disproving the claim, and were performed in many different countries to ensure representative data. All 13 of the studies in the first round failed to support an association between the MMR vaccine and autism, effectively refuting Wakefield’s results.

Sadly, by the time the first wave of studies was finishing up, the anti-vax movement had already taken its roots. When the first wave studies came out disproving an association between the MMR vaccine and autism, anti-vaxxers refocused their movement on vaccines containing thimerosal, which is “an antibacterial compound” that is “50% [mercury] by weight” because the US Food and Drug Administration essentially deemed that mercury was dangerous and children might be receiving too much of it at a young age. The anti-vaxxers blamed the excessive amount of mercury consumed on vaccinations containing thimerosal. So, in a similar fashion to the years prior, a second wave of studies (2003-2006) were performed whose goal was to disprove “an association between thimerosal in vaccines and autism”. 7 observational studies were completed in many countries, and they all came back with the same result. No evidence of an association between thimerosal vaccines and autism.
	
	
Today, the anti-vaccination movement still exists. Thriving on archaic fear, the movement forms radical, unsubstantiated theories about various ways that vaccines can cause autism. Amidst all the chaos what’s comforting to remember is that when radical claims are made - they will be tested by the scientific community. As we progress forward, we will come closer to the truth with every new discovery, even despite those who try to lead us astray.
