<p>In the article, “These Are the Busiest Days for Holiday Travel This Year”, Jessica Puckett focuses on when you should be traveling during the holidays this year. Holiday travel plans can be hard sometimes, as the airport can become chaotic and crowded with many people, so it is best to know when to plan your travels accordingly. During the 2018 Thanksgiving season, more than 25 million passengers traveled through U.S. airports, which was an increase of 5% from the 2017 Thanksgiving season. In 2018, TSA predicted that the Friday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving would be the most popular day to fly out, as 2.6 million people and crew flew out on both of these days. For 2019, Expedia and AAA predicted busiest day to fly out for Thanksgiving are Tuesday and Wednesday, as Thanksgiving falls on Thursday. For the 2018 Christmas season, 41 million passengers traveled through nationwide airports, which was a 6% increase from the 2017 Christmas season. Kayak, AAA, and Expedia all predict that Saturday (12/21) will be the busiest day to travel prior to Christmas. Puckett used sources such as TSA and traveling agencies to summarize which days are best to travel for this upcoming holiday season. The data enhanced this article as it was collected from organizations such as TSA, Kayak, AAA, and Expedia, which are well known and legitimate, which makes the evidence trustworthy. Also, Puckett occasionally linked some of her sources, which allowed the reader to click on it and see what she mentioned. The article could have however benefitted from data such as the most common flight days over the past 10 years, rather than just simply stating how many people flew out on the most popular day on the year prior. Also, it could have benefitted from more statistics from the actual name agencies, rather than just stating they were from the specific agency. This article could have improved on its explanations, as it could have gone more in depth with the number of ticket sales per day in the week prior to the holiday, and compare the statistics on those. Overall, this article was an interesting way to learn what days you should try to book for during the holidays.</p>
