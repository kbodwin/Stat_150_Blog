<p>As it turns out, clinical trials aren’t so clinical after all. Not what you would expect, right? The primary reason for this is the manipulation of test results by researchers that is encouraged by many academic journals, as they typically have a strong preference of publishing positive test results - those that show a treatment works better than previous ones - rather than those that are negative - those that show a treatment doesn’t work or isn’t as effective as previous ones. And as for researchers who don’t follow by this, they have a very hard time publishing their results in a respected journal, and unfortunately they often never see the light of day. This is unfortunate because even though negative results aren’t the sexiest, they are just as useful to society as postive results since they indicate what doesn’t work, not only what does, which is important for improving treatments, which ultimately should be the goal of clinical tests. However, a new type of journal article called Registered Reports may be the savior to these problems, as they publish trial results regardless of whether they’re positive or negative. They have been proposed as a reform and already started to be used by many academic journals, which hopefully is a sign of things to come since many people’s lives depend on these tests.</p>

<p>The article “Clinical trials revolution could change the future of medical research” by Chris Chambers discusses the credibility and accessibility of both research and trials in the scientific field. Over the previous years, there has been concern about the inability to reproduce results of studies. To combat this concern, research data has become more available to the public. This is just one of the many reforms happening currently in science, with another being a journal article called a “Registered Report.” This report is a reform in clinical medicine in which the journal publishes the trial no matter the outcome.</p>
<p>Clinical trials are very complicated and are often life and death situations. One problem of clinical trials is publication bias. Publication bias is the tendency to publish certain results over others, with the published ones often being the positive outcomes and the non-published ones being the negative outcomes. This is because journals are only interested in successes and some successful trials may even garner the attention of a prestigious medical journal. Being published is a significant accomplishment for a scientist. On the other hand, while a negative result is not necessarily a bad look on a scientist, it is not a result that gets published and therefore does not help their career. This dilemma is not good for science because negative results, which show that a treatment doesn’t work, is a very important finding as well. Publication bias results in 33 - 60% of clinical trials never being reported.</p>
<p>Another problem of trials is what is known as “hidden outcome switching.” This is when the researcher will change the outcome by using different types of analysis after seeing the data. This is done because researchers want a positive outcome due to publication bias, so they alter the outcome of the research which leads to false discoveries. In 2014, an analysis found that one third of trials “change their primary outcome measure,” showcasing just how big of a problem hidden outcome switching is. These problems are why Registered Reports, a new type of journal articles, have been commonly proposed as a reform and many academic journals have started using it. They would get rid of publication bias and therefore get rid of hidden outcome switching as well. In a registered report, researchers would submit their protocol before collecting data, and if they follow their protocol, then publication is guaranteed regardless of the outcome. By putting equal importance on positive and negative outcomes, the scientific community will benefit greatly.
