<p>Hadley Wickham was born in the city of Hamilton, New Zealand, in 1979. He started his statistics career at a young age when, at 15, he developed Microsoft Access Databases that the company still uses today. Statistics runs in the Wickham family; his father has a PhD in statistics and his sister Charlotte is an assistant professor of statistics at Oregon State University. Wickham switched gears and received a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of Auckland, NZ. However, he then went on to get his master’s degree in statistics from the same school, and later got his PhD from Iowa State University. He is now the chief scientist of RStudio and an adjunct professor of statistics at the University of Auckland, Rice University, and Stanford University.</p>
<p>Wickham is most well known in the statistics community as the man who ‘revolutionized R’. In 2005, he released his first package known as ‘reshape’ that is still constantly being used and built upon in the programming community. Over the years he has developed many more well known packages for R programming such as plyr, ggplot2, dplyr, and reshape2. All of Wickham’s packages are collectively known as the ‘tidyverse’ because of the tidy approach in making variables, observations, and each observational unit into columns, rows, and tables.</p>
<p>In addition to R packages, Wickham builds tools that are both cognitive and computational and make data science faster, simpler, and more enjoyable. He divides his work into three categories consisting of tools for data science, software engineering, and data import. Wickham has also written several books such as ‘R for Data Science’, which introduces key tools with R needed for data science. He also teaches a series of in-person workshops covering a broad range of topics such as an introduction to R, building tidy tools, and machine learning.</p>
<p>Outside of work, Wickham loves to make cocktails and bake, and even has a website with all his family recipes for others to try. Wickham is now residing in Texas with his partner Jeff and dog.</p>
