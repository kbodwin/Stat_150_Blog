<p>If you lose a personal item somewhere on campus, you can go to <a href="https://afd.calpoly.edu/facilities/services/lost-and-found" class="uri">https://afd.calpoly.edu/facilities/services/lost-and-found</a> and file a lost item report.</p>
<p>If they do not have your item, seek out the head of whichever building you lost the item in.</p>
<p>For example, if you lost an item in our Statistics classroom (Room 123A of building 38), you go to the ethics department office located south of our classroom on the first floor.</p>
