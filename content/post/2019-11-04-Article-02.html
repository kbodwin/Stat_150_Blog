<h2>Blurb</h2>
<p>In this TED talk, Professor Arthur Benjamin of Harvey Mudd University describes his thoughts on mathematics curriculum and how it’s attachment to calculus is somewhat archaic, and a newer more useful approach would be to focus on statistics and a more modern and concrete approach to mathematics using statistics and data.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this TED talk, Arthur Benjamin, a professor of mathematics at Harvey Mudd University, who has accomplished many mathematical feats in his field reveals something that challenges the entire basis of mathematics curriculum: that calculus should be taught instead of statistics.</p>
<p>In the majority of people’s everyday lives, they will not be using calculus nearly as much as they use statistics. In everything that we use daily there is data present and an opportunity to analyze and recognize that data for what it means and represents. So in his talk, Benjamin highlights this flaw in the mathematics education system.</p>
<p>He points out that it is still important to learn calculus depending on the field that someone goes into as well and that calculus has written some of the laws of nature as we know them, but even he admits that as a professor of mathematics himself, statistics is more useful for most people than calculus.</p>
<p>While it is important for everyone to learn statistics as it is so widely applicable in nearly all career fields, teaching statistics before calculus could end up leaving students more confused on the already complicated mathematics subjects. As Benjamin says, the current state of mathematics education builds up in a pyramid-esque fashion, with the pinnacle being calculus. This pyramid begins with pre-algebra, expands to algebra and trigonometry, and is “complete” through single-variable calculus, which utilizes everything from linear equations, polynomials, and unit circles by which students have been taught for the past 4-5 years. Placing statistics before the “calculus pinnacle” deviates from the clear, building-block path as statistics is almost a completely separate subject. Further, understanding calculus makes the concepts taught in basic statistics (i.e. cdf) easier to comprehend. While it is important for all students to take a statistics class before graduating high school, perhaps it would be better for this class to be taken concurrently with calculus rather than a class that disrupts the natural flow of the calculus progression.</p>
