<p>Learning statistics should be prioritized before studying calculus.</p>
<p>Ever wonder when calculus is actually going to be useful? Most schools design math classes in a way that builds up to the idea of calculus; calculus may not be useful for everyone. Arthur Benjamin, in his TED Talk “Teach Statistics Before Calculus,” advocates for placing priority on the education of statistics over calculus. Of course for students in the field of math, science, engineering, or economics, calculus is essential class to take, but others may find the study irrelevant in their daily lives. Even students that learn calculus fail to use it in a “conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.” In contrast, statistics helps us understand data and involves risk and randomness. As our lives shift to the digital direction, mathematics should move in the same way. Benjamin wants to ditch the “more classical, continuous mathematics” and enter the “modern, discrete mathematics—the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data.” Statistics is relevant to everyone’s lives today.</p>
<pre><code>Similarly Jo Boaler and Steven D. Levitt in the article “Opinion: Modern high school math should be about data —not Algebra 2” explain that data analysis should be a part of the core high school mathematics curriculum. Students need to be taught information that they will actually use. Learning how to use data to back up claims helps develop critical thinking skills. Furthermore the world is based off data, and students can solve real issues with the use of data. Other countries like the UK and Canada have already started to base mathematics curriculum on statistics. Mathematics in the United States needs to be modernized to adequately prepare students for real life issues!  


Lastly, in yet another article titled [&quot;Calculus and Statistics&quot;](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2013/07/01/calculus-and-statistics/), published in AMSTAT NEWS by Daniel Kaplan, several reasons are laid out as to why statistics should be prioritized over calculus in high school. Kaplan derives his claims from much of the same reasoning utilized by Arthur Benjamin, Jo Boaler, and Steven D. Levitt, mainly in that statistics in more widely used in careers than calculus is. But a new point touched upon in this article is that students are showing growing interest in learning statistics each year. Such is evident in the upward trend of students taking AP Statistics courses in highschool in recent years. Additionally, in 2003, the Mathematical Association of America Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics had set regulations to recommend that students have a calculus prerequisite before learning statistics. However, in more recent meetings aimed to improve mathematics curriculums, reports have shown that this calculus prerequisite is no longer deemed “recommended” before taking statistics. So, in the new age of education, it seems that statistics is taking precedence over calculus and the education system is slowly starting to adapt to new mindsets. 


Overall, it is apparent that the overarching recent consensus is that statistics’ importance is not only growing to match our technologically evolving world, but it is also growing to trump that of calculus. As a result, the education of the youth should prioritize statistics over calculus to set up a smarter future for everybody.</code></pre>
