Your writeup here.

David Blackwell was an American statistician and mathematician who made significant contributions to game theory, probability theory, information theory, and Bayesian statistics. He was born on April 24, 1919 in Illinois and was the son of a railroad worker. As a boy, he taught himself how to read and studied the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign at age 16, where he later received his bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degree by age 22. He eventually won the John Von Neumann Theory Prize for his contributions in developing Markovian decision processes and for work in the theory of dynamic programming.

Blackwell worked at a numerous amount of colleges such as Southern University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Clark College, Atlanta, before he received an appointment in the mathematics department at Howard University in Washington, D.C., in 1944. He then became head of the department in 1947. In 1954, Blackwell was invited to join the faculty at the University of California, Berekeley, where he became their first African American tenured professor. He served as a chairman of the statistics department from 1957 to 1961. He was also appointment professor of mathematics in 1973 and he retired in 1988. 
He broke racial barriers when we was named the first African American member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1965. Blackwell held a fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, but exclusion from numerous research opportunities and lectures led to his departure.

His work in math and statistics include his contributions to establishing the basis for dynamic programming, which is used in finance and genome analysis, renewal theorem, which is used in engineering and for the Rao-Blackwell Theorem, which is a fundamental concept in modern statistics. He also made contributions to game theory by applying it to military situations. Additionally, his book “Basic Statistics,” was one of the first textbooks on Bayesian statistics, which assesses probability based on new data, as it arises, rather than past data. Blackwell passed away on July 8, 2010 in Berkeley at age 91.
