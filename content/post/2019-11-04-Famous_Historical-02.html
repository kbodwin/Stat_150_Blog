<p>John Tukey was an American statistician of the mid 1900’s who played a significant role in introducing concepts and terminology used in modern statistics. Born in 1915, Tukey was homeschooled by both his parents who were teachers. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in chemistry at Brown University and a Master’s Degree a year later. He then attended Princeton University to study mathematics and obtained his Ph.D. During World War II, Tukey worked at the Fire Control Research Office and contributed to the development of artillery using statistics. At the age of 35 he became a professor teaching primarily abstract mathematics at Princeton University and later became a founding member of Princeton University’s statistics department in 1965. The statistics department split from the mathematics department one year later. He also worked at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories as well as in the government in the public service sector advising on environmental concerns, nuclear disarmament, and the school system. In the numerous jobs he worked, he served as a consultant in education, military operations, the census, and elections. Tukey is noted for criticizing the Kinsey Report in his publication Statistical Problems of the Kinsey Report on Sexual Behavior in the Human Male that pointed out the flaws of Kinsey’s research. In 1973, he was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Nixon and the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers Medal of Honour in 1982. He retired in 1985 and died in 2002.</p>
<p>Tukey made numerous contributions in various aspects in the field of statistics most noticeably in methods of displaying data, developing concepts in modern technology, and introducing terms used in the modern world of computer science. He is most known for his development of the Fast Fourier Transform, an important algorithm used by scientists and mathematicians for understanding waveforms, signal processing, and data analysis. He researched methods in graphing data for analysis and created the box plot, the stem-and-leaf diagram, and Tukey’s paired comparisons box-and-whisker plots. Many of his statistical creations also bear his name including: Tukey’s range test, Tukey lambda distribution, Tukey’s test of additivity, and Tukey’s lemma. He also invented the methods of trimean and median-median line which is an easier alternative to linear regression. Tukey emphasized distinguishing between exploratory and confirmatory data analysis stating that there was too much attention placed on confirmatory data analysis. He contributed to the development of “robust analysis” which is a statistical approach that protects against wrong answers from a sample data set that does not accurately represent the dataset as a whole. Many of the terms Tukey coined are used in the modern world of statistics and technology. When Tukey was working at AT&amp;T Bell Lab as a researcher, he created the term “bit” by combining the “binary” and “digit”. Tukey is also credited with coining the term “software” as a way to describe the programs used by computers. Having spent the majority of his life dedicated to research, publishing, learning, and using statistics, Tukey pioneered many of the tools, terms, and methods used in a vast number of fields today.</p>
