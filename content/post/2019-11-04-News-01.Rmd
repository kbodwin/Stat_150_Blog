San Francisco, Oakland-Berkeley and to a lesser extent San Mateo County have been outperforming the rest of the Bay Area since spring, according to Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst with the Compass real estate brokerage. “My best guess is that the differentiating factor (in these markets) is all the IPOs that have occurred over the last six months,” he said — even though it wasn’t “the hysterical jump” in prices that some were anticipating.

In the Article above, the author, Kathleen Pender talks about how in the Bay Area, housing prices have been on a steep incline over the past few years. She presents data about how “The median price paid for a new or existing Bay Area home or condo was $810,000 last month, down 0.7% from July and down 2.4% from August of last year.” 
She also talks about how in different cities, such as San Francisco have it much worse. In San Francisco, the median was $1.35 million, the highest in the whole Bay Area. Throughout the Article, Pender cites her sources mostly from a company called CoreLogic. She reiterates statistics stated by a top analyst at CoreLogic, Andrew LePage. She also uses statistics from a website called FreddieMac, a federal home loan mortgage corporation. Pender also gets information from Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst with the Compass real estate brokerage.

The data used in this article enhances the ethos and gives the writer more credibility. Without statistics to back up what she is writing about, people would  be less inclined to believe her. The data is also quite alarming to read about and it definitely catches the eye when reading through the article. Overall the data provided enhances the article and makes it stronger. 

The only thing that would make this article better was if the author, Kathleen Pender, provided more statistics and data on places outside of the Bay area too. Since the Bay Area has such a special housing market, it would make an even stronger argument if you showed the increases in other areas that have not experienced so much growth over the past few years. To someone who is unfamiliar with the housing market it would put it in a much greater perspective on just how high the Bay Area housing market is if data was shown from other places in California such as Clovis, or Merced where the median price of houses are $341,000 and $248,000 respectively (Zillow).
