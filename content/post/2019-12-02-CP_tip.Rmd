## Dietary Restrictions

Having trouble with dietary restrictions on campus? Go to https://www.calpolydining.com/nutritioncalculator/  where you can see the nutrition information and calculator for each food service on campus. Simply filter by one of the restaurants and see itâ€™s whole menu laid out in a way to show you what is vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, dairy free, and much more. This way you can see which restaurants or food options work best for your needs!


## Check your balance

Use budget buddy https://www.calpolydining.com/budget-buddy/ to see if you are on track for spending on your meal plan! It helps you see how much you should be spending on average to day, and what your meal plan credit should be at that very second.
