<p>The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis revolves around the importance of ethics in human experiments. In this study, 600 African men were recruited, 201 without syphilis and 399 with the disease, after being promised access to medical care for free. Despite promises of free medical care, the men were only given placebos, even when penicillin became available as a treatment in 1947 in order to continue with the experiment, which aimed to track the progression of Syphilis in those affected.</p>

<p>Modern day’s science is based heavily on experimentation, choosing a hypothesis and a proper randomized way to test it. However, in times past often times an ethical viewpoint was missing. The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment began in 1931, when there was no known treatment for syphilis. This study was conducted by doctors from the United States Public Health Service, and was lead by Dr. John Cutler. The study followed the initial 600 men enrolled in the project throughout their lifetime, with the participants not being treated, to track the progression of syphilis. This continued even through when a recommended treatment of syphilis was found, and until the information got leaked out to the public after investigator’s Peter Buxton found out about the experiment. This information prompted outrage and led the study to be shut down over 40 years later, in 1973.</p>
<p>The main takeaway message from this study is about data ethics. Clearly, this study violated basic human ethics principles, leading to the deaths of over 100 African men, many of which could’ve been prevented through newly discovered treatments such as penicillin. Due to the researchers not providing care, not only were these men left going blind, insane, or experiencing other major health complications, but the disease spread to spouses and children unnecessarily. Due to this study becoming public, new guidelines for U.S. funded research projects were released regarding data ethics in order to protect human subjects.</p>
<p>The most shocking part of the experiment was the fact that researchers were unable to provide effective care to these men - men who were promised free medical care for their participation. Researchers watched the full effects of the effects syphilis can leave on the human body without intervening to provide much needed medical care, as they only received placebos, such as aspirin and mineral supplements. Luckily, due to outrage, the experiment was forced to stop; however, this was after many individuals died untreated.</p>
