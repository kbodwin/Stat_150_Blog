<p>A researcher has resigned from his position at the University of Cornell due to many of his studies being redacted for faulty research practices. Brain Wansink is being removed from his once prominent position as director for Cornell’ Food and Brand Lab, where he was considered an eating behavior expert. Wansink’s offenses that include “missreporting of research data, problematic statistical techniques, failure to properly document and preserve research results, and inappropriate authorship,” said Michael I. Kotlikoff, another senior researcher at Cornell.</p>

<p>Brain Wansink, the leader of Cornell’s Food and Brand Lab recently resigned from his position. He formerly led studies in food psychology, consumer behavior, nutrition and obesity research and was considered an expert. However, the school had a yearlong review which determined that he committed academic conduct. More specifically, he was cited for ‘misreporting research data, problematic statistical techniques, failure to properly document and preserve research results, and inappropriate authorship.’ Six of his research studies were retracted by the medical journals that were published from 2005 to 2014. Wansink often published studies that made eye catching headlines. He helped Google and the US Army implement programs to encourage healthy eating based off of his studies. In addition, Wansink helped shape food companies marketing strategies, and worked in the White House to influence food policy in the country. One of these studies that has been retracted was one on serving bowl sizes. He concluded that the size of the serving bowl suggests to people the appropriate amount to eat. This study and others like it have since been retracted. Unfortunately, his studies have already been cited over 30,000 times according to Google Scholar. This demonstrates another issue with research that has faulty scientific backing. Wansink’s work has now hurt the credibility of thousands of other works because of one person’s academic misconduct. However, Wansink claims that his studies are valid, and that scientists will be able to replicate his studies.</p>
<p>Wansink believes that he and Cornell University simply have different approaches to researching and he didn’t intentionally misreport or plagiarize anything. He acknowledges that he made some errors in his research studies. These include incorrect descriptions of participants ages, typos, and ‘statistical mistakes’. He claims that these did not affect that results of the study except for one. Again, he stands by his statement that this was not intentional. However, other scientists accuse Wansink of ‘p-hacking’. This means that once he achieves a result of p&lt;0.5 he stops his experiment. Instead of testing a hypothesis and reporting whatever the findings were, he crunched data in ways that would create more interesting or desirable results. Wansink went into experiments wanting a statistically significant result, so he would find ways of creating it by manipulating the data. Wansink has also been called out for applauding a student who ‘kept analyzing the data until she found a meaningful relationship.’ Fellow scientists find this sentiment disturbing because this is not how the scientific method is supposed to work. The scientific method says that researchers should generate a hypothesis, test it, then make a conclusion. This means that generating data, then make conclusions should not be applauded.</p>
